        - "Causes a syntax error"
      correctAnswer: "Assigns 'Adult' if age is 18 or more, otherwise assigns 'Minor'"
      explanation: "The ternary operator is a shorthand if/else: condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse. It evaluates the condition and returns the appropriate value."

    - question: "Can you use an if statement without an else?"
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: true
      explanation: "True! The else clause is optional. If the condition is false and there's no else, the code simply skips the if block and continues."

    - question: "What will this code output? `for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { console.log(i); }`"
      type: single
      options:

        - "1 2 3"
        - "0 1 2 3"
        - "3"
      correctAnswer: "0 1 2"
      explanation: "The loop starts at 0, runs while i < 3, and increments i each time. It outputs 0, then 1, then 2, then stops (3 is not less than 3)."

# Control Flow in JavaScript

Control flow is how you tell your program to make decisions and repeat actions. Without control flow, code would just run line by line from top to bottom. With it, you can check conditions, loop through data, and respond to different situations.

This lesson covers the three main control flow tools:
- **Conditionals** (if/else) - make decisions
- **Loops** (for, while, for...of) - repeat code
- **Ternary operator** - concise conditionals

## What is Control Flow?

Control flow determines the order in which code executes. Think of it like a flowchart - at each decision point, you choose which path to take.

## Conditionals - Making Decisions

Conditionals let you run code only when certain conditions are true.

### Basic if Statement

The `if` statement executes code when a condition is true.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to run if condition is true
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
const age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult");
}
// Output: You are an adult
```

### if...else Statement

Add an `else` to run code when the condition is false.

```javascript
const temperature = 15;

if (temperature > 25) {
  console.log("It's hot outside");
} else {
  console.log("It's cool outside");
}
// Output: It's cool outside
```

### if...else if...else Chain

Check multiple conditions in sequence.

```javascript
const score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: F");
}
// Output: Grade: B
```

**How it Works:**
- JavaScript checks conditions top to bottom
- It runs the first block whose condition is true
- Once a block runs, it skips the rest

### Logical Operators in Conditionals

Combine conditions with logical operators:

- `&&` (AND) - both conditions must be true
- `||` (OR) - at least one condition must be true
- `!` (NOT) - inverts a boolean

```javascript
const age = 25;
const hasLicense = true;

// AND - both must be true
if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
  console.log("You can drive");
}
// Output: You can drive

// OR - at least one must be true
const isWeekend = false;
const isHoliday = true;

if (isWeekend || isHoliday) {
  console.log("No work today!");
}
// Output: No work today!

// NOT - inverts the value
const isLoggedIn = false;

if (!isLoggedIn) {
  console.log("Please log in");
}
// Output: Please log in
```

## Loops - Repeating Code

Loops execute code multiple times. Use them to process arrays, count, or repeat until a condition is met.

### for Loop - Classic Counter

The `for` loop runs a specific number of times.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to repeat
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration: " + i);
}
// Output:
// Iteration: 0
// Iteration: 1
// Iteration: 2
// Iteration: 3
// Iteration: 4
```

**Breakdown:**
- `let i = 0` - start at 0
- `i < 5` - continue while i is less than 5
- `i++` - increment i after each iteration

**Looping Through Arrays:**

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}
// Output:
// apple
// banana
// orange
```

### for...of Loop - Iterate Over Values

The `for...of` loop is a modern, cleaner way to iterate over array values.

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

for (const color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
// Output:
// red
// green
// blue
```

**When to Use:**
- Use `for...of` when you need the values
- Use traditional `for` when you need the index

### while Loop - Repeat Until Condition is False

The `while` loop runs as long as a condition is true.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to repeat
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
let count = 0;

while (count < 3) {
  console.log("Count: " + count);
  count++;
}
// Output:
// Count: 0
// Count: 1
// Count: 2
```

**Warning:** Make sure the condition eventually becomes false, or you'll create an infinite loop!

```javascript
// ❌ Infinite loop - AVOID!
let x = 0;
while (x < 10) {
  console.log(x);
  // Forgot to increment x - runs forever!
}
```

### do...while Loop - Run At Least Once

The `do...while` loop runs the code first, then checks the condition.

```javascript
let i = 0;

do {
  console.log("Iteration: " + i);
  i++;
} while (i < 3);
// Output:
// Iteration: 0
// Iteration: 1
// Iteration: 2
```

**Difference from while:** The code runs at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

```javascript
let x = 10;

do {
  console.log("This runs once");
} while (x < 5);
// Output: This runs once (even though x is not < 5)
```

### Loop Control - break and continue

**break** - Exit the loop early

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Stop the loop
  }
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 2 3 4 (stops at 5)
```

**continue** - Skip to next iteration

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue; // Skip this iteration
  }
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 3 4 (skips 2)
```

## Ternary Operator - Concise Conditionals

The ternary operator is a shorthand for simple if/else statements.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
```

**Example:**

```javascript
const age = 20;
const status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";

console.log(status); // Output: Adult
```

**Equivalent if/else:**

```javascript
let status;
if (age >= 18) {
  status = "Adult";
} else {
  status = "Minor";
}
```

**Use Cases:**

```javascript
// Assign values conditionally
const discount = isMember ? 0.1 : 0;

// Display text conditionally
const message = isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in";

// Inline in JSX/templates (common in React/Vue)
<p>{isOnline ? "Online" : "Offline"}</p>
```

**Nested Ternary (Use Sparingly):**

```javascript
const score = 85;
const grade = score >= 90 ? "A" : score >= 80 ? "B" : "C";

console.log(grade); // Output: B
```

**Warning:** Nested ternaries get hard to read. Use if/else for complex conditions.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: User Authentication

```javascript
const user = {
  isLoggedIn: true,
  role: "admin"
};

if (user.isLoggedIn) {
  if (user.role === "admin") {
    console.log("Welcome, Admin!");
  } else {
    console.log("Welcome, User!");
  }
} else {
  console.log("Please log in");
}
// Output: Welcome, Admin!
```

### Example 2: Processing a Shopping Cart

```javascript
const cart = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1000 },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 25 },
  { name: "Keyboard", price: 75 }
];

let total = 0;

for (const item of cart) {
  total += item.price;
  console.log(`Added ${item.name}: $${item.price}`);
}

console.log(`Total: $${total}`);
// Output:
// Added Laptop: $1000
// Added Mouse: $25
// Added Keyboard: $75
// Total: $1100
```

### Example 3: Finding Users

```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", active: true },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", active: false },
  { id: 3, name: "Charlie", active: true }
];

// Find and display active users
for (const user of users) {
  if (user.active) {
    console.log(`${user.name} is active`);
  }
}
// Output:
// Alice is active
// Charlie is active
```

### Example 4: Input Validation

```javascript
const validateAge = (age) => {
  if (age === undefined || age === null) {
    return "Age is required";
  } else if (typeof age !== "number") {
    return "Age must be a number";
  } else if (age < 0) {
    return "Age cannot be negative";
  } else if (age < 18) {
    return "Must be 18 or older";
  } else {
    return "Valid age";
  }
};

console.log(validateAge(25));    // Output: Valid age
console.log(validateAge(-5));    // Output: Age cannot be negative
console.log(validateAge("abc")); // Output: Age must be a number
```

## Try It Yourself

**Exercise 1: Grade Calculator**

Write a function that takes a score and returns a grade.

```javascript
const getGrade = (score) => {
  if (score >= 90) return "A";
  if (score >= 80) return "B";
  if (score >= 70) return "C";
  if (score >= 60) return "D";
  return "F";
};

console.log(getGrade(85)); // Should output: B
console.log(getGrade(92)); // Should output: A
console.log(getGrade(55)); // Should output: F
```

**Exercise 2: Even Numbers**

Use a loop to print even numbers from 0 to 10.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
// Should output: 0 2 4 6 8 10
```

**Exercise 3: Ternary Operator**

Rewrite this if/else as a ternary operator:

```javascript
let message;
if (temperature > 30) {
  message = "It's hot";
} else {
  message = "It's not hot";
}

// Ternary version:
const message = temperature > 30 ? "It's hot" : "It's not hot";
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to increment loop counters**
   - Always change the condition variable in while loops
   - Prevents infinite loops

2. **Using assignment (=) instead of comparison (===)**
   - `if (x = 5)` assigns 5 to x (always true!)
   - `if (x === 5)` checks if x equals 5 ✅

3. **Complex nested ternaries**
   - Nested ternaries are hard to read
   - Use if/else for complex conditions

4. **Not using braces for single-line blocks**
   - Always use braces `{ }` even for one line
   - Prevents bugs when adding more lines later

5. **Comparing with == instead of ===**
   - Use `===` (strict equality) to avoid type coercion surprises
   - `5 == "5"` is true, but `5 === "5"` is false ✅

## Key Takeaways

- **if/else statements** make decisions based on conditions
- **for loops** are best when you know how many times to repeat
- **for...of loops** cleanly iterate over array values
- **while loops** repeat until a condition becomes false
- **Ternary operator** provides concise if/else for simple conditions
- Use `===` for comparisons to avoid type coercion
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) combine and invert conditions
- `break` exits loops, `continue` skips to the next iteration

Control flow is fundamental to programming. Master these structures, and you'll write code that makes intelligent decisions and processes data efficiently. Practice combining conditionals and loops to solve real-world problems.
