# SDLC Phases - Quick Reference

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Purpose | Key Output |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Requirements | Define what to build | Requirements document |
| Design | Plan how to build it | Architecture diagrams |
| Development | Write the code | Working software |
| Testing | Verify it works | Test reports, bug fixes |
| Deployment | Release to users | Live application |
| Maintenance | Keep it running | Updates, fixes |

## Requirements Gathering

### Types of Requirements

| Type | Focus | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Functional | What it does | Users can log in |
| Non-Functional | How well it works | Pages load in 3 seconds |

### Gathering Techniques

- **Interviews** - One-on-one stakeholder discussions
- **Surveys** - Large-scale input collection
- **Workshops** - Group sessions for consensus
- **Observation** - Watching users work
- **Document Analysis** - Reviewing existing systems

### Quality Requirements

✅ Clear - Single meaning, no jargon
✅ Testable - Can prove it works
✅ Complete - Nothing important missing
✅ Consistent - No contradictions

## Design & Architecture

### Design Levels

| Level | Focus | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| High-Level | System structure | Tech stack, architecture pattern |
| Low-Level | Component details | Database schema, API endpoints |

### Architectural Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Monolith | Single deployable unit | Small teams, simple apps |
| Microservices | Independent services | Large teams, complex systems |
| Layered | Presentation → Logic → Data | Clear separation of concerns |

### Design Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| KISS | Keep It Simple |
| DRY | Don't Repeat Yourself |
| Single Responsibility | One job per component |
| Open/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification |

## Development & Coding

### Version Control Best Practices

- ✅ Commit small, focused changes
- ✅ Write clear commit messages
- ✅ Use branches for features
- ✅ Pull latest before starting
- ❌ Never commit secrets

### Good vs Bad Commits

```bash
# Bad
git commit -m "fixed stuff"

# Good
git commit -m "Fix user login timeout after 30 seconds"
```

### Technical Debt

| Cause | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Rushing deadlines | Plan realistic timelines |
| Skipping tests | Require test coverage |
| Copy-paste code | Create reusable functions |
| Ignoring reviews | Enforce review process |

## Testing & QA

### Testing Pyramid

| Layer | Speed | Quantity | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| E2E | Slow | Few | Full user journeys |
| Integration | Medium | Some | API + database tests |
| Unit | Fast | Many | Function-level tests |

### Testing Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Unit | Test individual functions |
| Integration | Test component connections |
| E2E | Test complete workflows |
| Regression | Ensure old features still work |
| Performance | Check speed under load |
| Security | Find vulnerabilities |

### Manual vs Automated

| Manual | Automated |
|--------|-----------|
| Exploratory testing | Regression testing |
| Usability evaluation | CI/CD pipelines |
| Visual verification | Performance testing |

## Deployment

### Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | Risk | Rollback | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| Big Bang | High | Slow | Small apps |
| Rolling | Medium | Medium | Stateless apps |
| Blue-Green | Low | Instant | Critical systems |
| Canary | Low | Fast | High-traffic apps |

### Deployment Checklist

- ☐ Build artifacts ready
- ☐ Configuration verified
- ☐ Database migrations tested
- ☐ Rollback plan documented
- ☐ Monitoring in place
- ☐ Team notified

### Best Practices

- **Automate** - Scripts over manual steps
- **Small changes** - Deploy frequently
- **Rollback ready** - Always have a plan B
- **Low traffic** - Deploy during quiet periods
- **Monitor** - Watch metrics after release

## Maintenance & Operations

### Types of Maintenance

| Type | Focus | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Corrective | Fix bugs | Patch login crash |
| Adaptive | Environment changes | Update for new OS |
| Perfective | Add features | New export option |
| Preventive | Code quality | Refactor messy code |

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Measures | Goal |
|--------|----------|------|
| MTBF | Time between failures | Higher |
| MTTR | Time to recover | Lower |
| Availability | Uptime percentage | Higher |

### Availability Targets

| Nines | Downtime/Year |
|-------|---------------|
| 99% | 3.65 days |
| 99.9% | 8.76 hours |
| 99.99% | 52.6 minutes |

### Incident Response

1. **Detect** - Alert triggers
2. **Respond** - Team mobilizes
3. **Restore** - Fix the problem
4. **Review** - Blameless post-mortem

## Quick Decision Guides

### When to Choose Microservices

✅ Large team with clear domain boundaries
✅ Need independent scaling
✅ Different tech stacks required
❌ Small team or simple application
❌ Limited DevOps experience

### When to Skip Low-Level Design

✅ Prototypes or MVPs
✅ Well-understood patterns
❌ Complex integrations
❌ Performance-critical systems

### Testing Investment Priority

1. **Always**: Unit tests for business logic
2. **Usually**: Integration tests for APIs
3. **Selectively**: E2E tests for critical paths
4. **As needed**: Performance and security tests

## Interview Quick Hits

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What are the main phases of SDLC? | Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance |
| What's the difference between functional and non-functional requirements? | Functional defines what the system does; non-functional defines how well it performs (speed, security, reliability) |
| What is the testing pyramid? | A strategy with many unit tests at the base, fewer integration tests in the middle, and fewest E2E tests at the top |
| What is blue-green deployment? | Running two identical environments and switching traffic between them for zero-downtime releases and instant rollback |
| What does MTTR measure? | Mean Time To Recovery - the average time to restore service after a failure |
| What are the four types of maintenance? | Corrective (fix bugs), Adaptive (environment changes), Perfective (add features), Preventive (improve code quality) |
