quiz:
  passingScore: 70
  questions:
    - question: "What is the main goal of the development phase?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To write code that implements the design specifications"
        - "To gather requirements from stakeholders"
        - "To test the application for bugs"
        - "To deploy software to production servers"
      correctAnswer: "To write code that implements the design specifications"
      explanation: "The development phase takes the technical designs and turns them into actual working code. Developers write, test, and integrate code to build the planned features."

    - question: "Select all practices that improve code quality during development."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Following consistent coding standards"
        - "Writing code as fast as possible without reviews"
        - "Using version control for all changes"
        - "Adding meaningful comments and documentation"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Following consistent coding standards"
        - "Using version control for all changes"
        - "Adding meaningful comments and documentation"
      explanation: "Quality code comes from standards, version control, and good documentation. Writing fast without reviews leads to bugs and technical debt."

    - question: "Technical debt refers to money owed by the development team."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "Technical debt is a metaphor. It refers to shortcuts or poor code that works now but will cause problems later. Like financial debt, it accumulates interest - the longer you wait to fix it, the harder it becomes."

    - question: "Why should developers commit code to version control frequently?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To create small, recoverable checkpoints of working code"
        - "To fill up the repository with more files"
        - "To avoid writing commit messages"
        - "To make code reviews harder"
      correctAnswer: "To create small, recoverable checkpoints of working code"
      explanation: "Frequent commits create a safety net. If something breaks, you can return to a recent working state. Small commits are also easier to review and understand."

# Development & Coding

Development is where plans become reality. Developers take the designs created in the previous phase and write code to make the software work. This phase often takes the most time in a project.

Writing code is only part of development. Good development also includes testing what you write, reviewing others' code, and keeping everything organized.

## What Happens During Development?

During development, the team transforms designs into working software. Developers write code, run tests, fix bugs, and integrate their work with others.

## Coding Standards

Coding standards are rules about how code should look and be organized. They make code consistent across the team.

### Why Standards Matter

When everyone follows the same standards:
- Code is easier to read
- New team members learn faster
- Reviews focus on logic, not formatting
- Automated tools can check compliance

### Common Standards Include

- **Naming conventions** - How to name variables, functions, and files
- **Formatting rules** - Indentation, line length, spacing
- **File organization** - Where different types of code belong
- **Comment requirements** - When and how to document code

```javascript
// Poor naming - unclear what this does
function calc(x, y) {
  return x * y * 0.15;
}

// Good naming - intention is clear
function calculateSalesTax(price, quantity) {
  const TAX_RATE = 0.15;
  return price * quantity * TAX_RATE;
}
```

## Version Control in Development

Version control tracks every change to the code. Git is the most popular version control system.

### Good Commit Messages

Commit messages explain what changed and why. Future developers (including yourself) will thank you.

```bash
# Bad commit messages
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "asdf"

# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Fix user login timeout after 30 seconds"
git commit -m "Add email validation to registration form"
git commit -m "Update database connection pool size to 20"
```

## Unit Testing During Development

Developers write tests alongside their code. Unit tests check that individual pieces work correctly.

```javascript
// Example: A simple function
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Example: A unit test for that function
test('addNumbers works correctly', () => {
  expect(addNumbers(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  expect(addNumbers(-1, 1)).toBe(0);
  expect(addNumbers(0, 0)).toBe(0);
});
```

### Why Test While Coding?

- Find bugs early when they are cheap to fix
- Prove that code works as expected
- Protect against future changes breaking things
- Document how code should behave

## Code Documentation

Good code explains itself, but documentation fills in the gaps.

### Code Comments

Comments explain the "why" behind code decisions:

```javascript
// Calculate shipping with a minimum charge
// Minimum exists because carrier requires $5 per package
if (shippingCost < 5.00) {
  shippingCost = 5.00;
}
```

### README Files

Every project needs a README that explains:
- What the project does
- How to set it up
- How to run it
- How to contribute

## Technical Debt

Technical debt happens when teams take shortcuts. The code works now but creates problems later.

Common causes:
- Rushing to meet deadlines
- Skipping tests
- Copy-pasting instead of creating reusable code
- Ignoring code review feedback

Like financial debt, technical debt accumulates interest. Small shortcuts become big problems. Teams should regularly pay down technical debt by refactoring and cleaning up code.

## Development in DevOps

In DevOps environments, development connects to automation:

- **Continuous Integration** runs tests automatically when code is pushed
- **Linters** check code style automatically
- **Pre-commit hooks** catch problems before code is committed
- **Feature flags** allow deploying code without activating it for users

## Key Takeaways

- Development transforms designs into working code
- Coding standards make code consistent and readable
- Version control tracks all changes and enables collaboration
- Unit tests verify code works and catch bugs early
- Documentation helps current and future team members understand the code

In the next lesson, you will learn about Testing and QA, where the team verifies that the developed software works correctly.
