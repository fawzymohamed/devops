  questions:
    - question: "What is the main difference between maintenance and operations?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Maintenance changes the software; operations keeps it running"
        - "Maintenance is free; operations costs money"
        - "Maintenance happens before deployment; operations happens during development"
        - "There is no difference; they are the same thing"
      correctAnswer: "Maintenance changes the software; operations keeps it running"
      explanation: "Maintenance involves changing code - fixing bugs, adding features, updating dependencies. Operations keeps the system healthy - monitoring, responding to incidents, managing infrastructure."

    - question: "Select all activities that are considered software maintenance."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Fixing bugs reported by users"
        - "Adding new features requested by business"
        - "Monitoring server CPU usage"
        - "Updating libraries to patch security issues"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Fixing bugs reported by users"
        - "Adding new features requested by business"
        - "Updating libraries to patch security issues"
      explanation: "Maintenance includes corrective (bug fixes), adaptive (environment changes), perfective (new features), and preventive (updates) work. Monitoring is an operations activity."

    - question: "Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) measures how long systems run without failures."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "MTTR measures how quickly you recover from failures, not how long between failures. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) measures time between incidents. Both metrics are important for reliability."

    - question: "Why is monitoring important for software operations?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To detect problems before users notice them"
        - "To make the application run faster"
        - "To reduce the cost of development"
        - "To replace the need for testing"
      correctAnswer: "To detect problems before users notice them"
      explanation: "Monitoring watches system health continuously. Good monitoring alerts teams to problems early - ideally before users are affected. This reduces downtime and improves user experience."

    - question: "What should happen first when a production incident occurs?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Restore service to users as quickly as possible"
        - "Find out who caused the problem"
        - "Write detailed documentation"
        - "Schedule a meeting for next week"
      correctAnswer: "Restore service to users as quickly as possible"
      explanation: "During an incident, the priority is restoring service. Root cause analysis and documentation come after. Blame is not productive - focus on fixing the problem and preventing it in the future."

# Maintenance & Operations

After deployment, software needs ongoing care. Maintenance fixes bugs and adds features. Operations keeps systems running smoothly. Together, they ensure software continues to deliver value over time.

This phase often lasts years - much longer than the initial development. Many organizations spend 60-80% of their IT budgets on maintenance and operations.

## Maintenance vs Operations

These two activities work together but focus on different things.

## Types of Maintenance

Software maintenance falls into four categories, each serving different needs.

### Corrective Maintenance

Fixing bugs and defects found after release. Users report problems, or monitoring catches errors.

**Examples:**
- Fixing a login page that crashes on certain browsers
- Correcting calculation errors in reports
- Patching security vulnerabilities

### Adaptive Maintenance

Changing software to work in new environments. The software itself is fine, but its surroundings changed.

**Examples:**
- Updating code for a new database version
- Adapting to new operating system requirements
- Integrating with updated third-party APIs

### Perfective Maintenance

Adding features and improvements based on user feedback. Making good software better.

**Examples:**
- Adding a requested export feature
- Improving search performance
- Redesigning the user interface

### Preventive Maintenance

Improving code quality to prevent future problems. Paying down technical debt.

**Examples:**
- Refactoring messy code
- Updating old dependencies
- Improving test coverage

## Operations Activities

Operations keeps software healthy and available. Key activities include monitoring, incident response, and capacity management.

### Monitoring

Watch system health continuously. Good monitoring tells you about problems before users complain.

**What to monitor:**
- **Application metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Infrastructure metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Business metrics**: Sign-ups, orders, revenue
- **Logs**: Application events and errors

### Alerting

Set up alerts for conditions that need attention:

- Error rate exceeds 1%
- Response time above 2 seconds
- Disk space below 10%
- Service becomes unavailable

Good alerts are actionable. They tell you something needs fixing now.

### Incident Response

When something breaks, respond quickly and systematically:

**Key incident response principles:**
- Restore service first, investigate later
- Communicate status to stakeholders
- Document what happened
- Conduct blameless post-mortems

### Capacity Management

Ensure systems have enough resources to handle load:

- Plan for growth
- Scale resources when needed
- Optimize costs by right-sizing
- Prepare for traffic spikes

## Key Metrics

These metrics help measure operational health:

**Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**
How long systems typically run without incidents. Higher is better.

**Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**
How quickly you restore service after an incident. Lower is better.

**Availability**
Percentage of time the system is accessible. Often expressed as "nines":
- 99% = 3.65 days downtime per year
- 99.9% = 8.76 hours downtime per year
- 99.99% = 52.6 minutes downtime per year

## Post-Incident Reviews

After major incidents, teams hold blameless reviews to learn and improve:

- What happened and why?
- What worked well in the response?
- What could be improved?
- What actions will prevent recurrence?

The goal is learning, not blame. When people fear punishment, they hide problems instead of fixing them.

## Maintenance in DevOps

DevOps breaks down walls between development and operations:

- **You build it, you run it**: Developers participate in operations
- **SRE practices**: Software engineering applied to operations
- **Automation**: Reduce manual operational work
- **Continuous improvement**: Use incidents to drive improvements

## Key Takeaways

- Maintenance changes software; operations keeps it running
- Four maintenance types: corrective, adaptive, perfective, preventive
- Monitoring and alerting catch problems early
- Incident response focuses on restoring service, then learning
- MTBF, MTTR, and availability measure operational health

This completes the SDLC Phases section. You now understand the complete journey from gathering requirements through maintaining a running system. In the next section, you will learn about Development Workflows that help teams work together effectively.
