        - "Gathering requirements for new projects"
        - "Designing system architecture"
      correctAnswer: "Keeping software running, fixing issues, and making improvements"

        - "Maximum Time To Review - how long code reviews take"
      correctAnswer: "Mean Time To Recovery - how quickly you restore service after failure"
      explanation: "MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) measures how quickly you fix problems. Lower MTTR means less downtime and happier users. It is a key reliability metric."

        - "Improving system performance"
      explanation: "Maintenance includes bug fixes, security updates, and performance improvements. Writing initial requirements happens in the requirements phase, before development."

    - question: "Operations teams should only respond to problems after users report them."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Good operations teams use monitoring and alerting to detect problems before users notice them. Proactive monitoring is essential for reliability."

    - question: "What is the purpose of a post-incident review (postmortem)?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To assign blame to the person who caused the incident"
        - "To learn from the incident and prevent similar ones in the future"
        - "To calculate how much money the incident cost"
        - "To decide who should be on call next week"
      correctAnswer: "To learn from the incident and prevent similar ones in the future"
      explanation: "Postmortems focus on learning, not blame. They document what happened, why, and what changes will prevent recurrence. Blame-free culture encourages honest reporting."

# Maintenance & Operations

Deployment is not the end - it is a new beginning. Once software is live, it must be kept running, fixed when broken, and improved over time. This phase often lasts years and requires ongoing effort.

Maintenance and operations is where software proves its value. Users are using it. Money is being made (or saved). Problems affect real people. The stakes are higher than ever.

## What is Maintenance and Operations?

After deployment, the work shifts to:

- **Keeping systems running** - Servers up, databases responding, services available
- **Fixing problems** - Bug fixes, incident response, troubleshooting
- **Improving performance** - Making things faster, more efficient
- **Adapting to change** - New requirements, updated dependencies, security patches
- **Supporting users** - Answering questions, resolving issues

## Types of Maintenance

### Corrective Maintenance

Fixing bugs and errors discovered after deployment. Users report problems, or monitoring reveals issues.

**Examples:**
- Fixing a calculation error in checkout
- Resolving a crash when users upload certain file types
- Correcting data corruption from a previous bug

### Adaptive Maintenance

Changes needed because the environment changed. New operating systems, updated browsers, changed APIs.

**Examples:**
- Updating for a new version of the database
- Adapting to changes in a third-party API
- Supporting a new browser or mobile OS

### Perfective Maintenance

Improvements that make the system better. New features, performance optimizations, user interface improvements.

**Examples:**
- Adding a feature users requested
- Making page loads 50% faster
- Redesigning a confusing workflow

### Preventive Maintenance

Work done to prevent future problems. Code cleanup, security updates, infrastructure improvements.

**Examples:**
- Updating dependencies before they become security risks
- Refactoring code that is becoming hard to maintain
- Adding monitoring before you need it

## Monitoring and Observability

You cannot fix what you cannot see. Monitoring tells you what is happening with your systems.

### Key Metrics to Watch

### The Three Pillars of Observability

**Metrics:** Numbers that show system health over time. CPU usage, request count, error rate.

**Logs:** Detailed records of what happened. Each request, error, and event recorded with timestamps.

**Traces:** Following a request through multiple services. Shows where time is spent and where failures occur.

## Alerting

Monitoring data is useless if nobody sees it. Alerts notify the right people when something needs attention.

### Good Alerts

Good alerts are:
- **Actionable** - You can do something about them
- **Urgent** - They need attention now
- **Clear** - You understand what is wrong
- **Rare** - Only fire when truly needed

### Bad Alerts

Bad alerts cause "alert fatigue":
- Fire too often (crying wolf)
- Unclear what to do
- Not urgent (could wait until morning)
- Noise that people learn to ignore

## Incident Response

When something breaks, you need a clear process to fix it.

### Incident Lifecycle

1. **Detection** - Monitoring alerts or user reports identify a problem
2. **Triage** - Assess severity and impact. How many users affected?
3. **Response** - Work to restore service as quickly as possible
4. **Communication** - Keep stakeholders informed of status
5. **Resolution** - Service fully restored
6. **Review** - Learn from what happened

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Example | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Critical | Service completely down | Site returns errors for all users | Immediate |
| High | Major feature broken | Checkout does not work | Within 1 hour |
| Medium | Partial degradation | Slow performance for some users | Within 4 hours |
| Low | Minor issue | Cosmetic bug | Next business day |

## Post-Incident Reviews

After major incidents, teams hold blameless postmortems to learn.

**Blameless culture is essential.** If people fear punishment, they hide problems. If problems are hidden, they cannot be fixed.

## Key Reliability Metrics

### MTBF - Mean Time Between Failures

How long systems typically run before failing. Higher is better.

### MTTR - Mean Time To Recovery

How quickly you restore service after a failure. Lower is better.

### Availability

Percentage of time the system is working. Often expressed as "nines":
- 99% = 87.6 hours downtime per year
- 99.9% = 8.76 hours downtime per year
- 99.99% = 52.6 minutes downtime per year

## DevOps and SRE Practices

DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) have transformed operations.

### Key DevOps Operations Practices

**Infrastructure as Code:** Manage servers and networks through version-controlled code. Repeatable and auditable.

**Automated Rollbacks:** When problems occur, automatically revert to the last good version.

**Chaos Engineering:** Intentionally break things to discover weaknesses before they cause real outages.

**On-Call Rotation:** Developers take turns being on call. They experience the pain of their own bugs.

## Security in Operations

Security is an ongoing operational concern:

- Apply security patches promptly
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Rotate secrets and credentials regularly
- Review access permissions periodically
- Respond to security incidents with urgency

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Treating operations as someone else's problem** - In DevOps, whoever builds it, runs it. Developers must care about operations.

2. **Ignoring monitoring until you need it** - Set up monitoring before problems occur. During an incident is too late.

3. **Blaming people for failures** - Blame creates fear. Fear hides problems. Focus on systems, not individuals.

4. **Deferring maintenance indefinitely** - Technical debt grows with interest. Budget time for maintenance.

5. **Not documenting procedures** - Runbooks save time during incidents when you cannot think clearly.

## Key Takeaways

- Maintenance and operations is the longest phase - software must be kept running for years
- Four types of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive
- Monitoring, alerting, and observability are essential for reliable systems
- Incident response needs clear processes, severity levels, and communication
- Blameless postmortems help teams learn and improve
- DevOps and SRE practices make operations more reliable and sustainable
- MTTR (how fast you recover) is more important than MTBF (how rarely you fail)
