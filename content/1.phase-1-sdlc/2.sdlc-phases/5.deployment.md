      correctAnswer: "Moving software from development to a live environment where users can access it"
      explanation: "Deployment is the process of releasing software so users can access it. This involves moving code, configuring systems, and verifying everything works in production."

      correctAnswers:
        - "Faster and more frequent releases"
        - "Fewer human errors during deployment"
        - "Consistent and repeatable process"
      explanation: "Automation makes deployments faster, reduces human error, and ensures consistency. However, testing is still essential - automation does not replace testing."

    - question: "Rollback is not important if you test thoroughly before deployment."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Even well-tested software can have problems in production due to differences in data, traffic, or configuration. Rollback capability is essential for safe deployments."

        - "Deploying to all users at once"
        - "Releasing to a small percentage of users first, then gradually expanding"
        - "Stopping the old version before starting the new one"
        - "Deploying only at night when users are asleep"
      correctAnswer: "Releasing to a small percentage of users first, then gradually expanding"
      explanation: "Canary deployments release to a small group first (like the canary in a coal mine). If problems appear, only a few users are affected. If everything works, traffic gradually increases."

# Deployment

Deployment is the moment of truth. All the planning, coding, and testing come together when software goes live. Users can finally access what the team has built.

But deployment is also risky. A bad deployment can break the system, frustrate users, and cost money. Good deployment practices make releases safe, fast, and reversible.

## What is Deployment?

Deployment is moving software from a development or staging environment to production - where real users access it.

This involves:
- Copying code and artifacts to production servers
- Updating databases if schemas changed
- Configuring environment-specific settings
- Starting new application instances
- Routing traffic to the new version
- Verifying everything works correctly

## Deployment Strategies

Different strategies balance speed, safety, and complexity. Choose based on your risk tolerance and infrastructure.

### Recreate Deployment

Stop the old version, then start the new version. Simple but causes downtime.

```
Old Version: ████████████ → Stop
                              Wait...
New Version:              → Start ████████████
```

**When to use:**
- Systems that can tolerate brief downtime
- Major database migrations that require the app to be offline
- Simple applications with few users

**Advantages:** Simple to implement and understand.
**Disadvantages:** Downtime between stopping old and starting new.

### Rolling Deployment

Gradually replace old instances with new ones. No downtime if you have multiple instances.

```
Old: ████ ████ ████ ████
     └────┘
New: ████ ████
          └────┘
New: ████ ████ ████
               └────┘
New: ████ ████ ████ ████
```

**When to use:**
- Most web applications
- Systems running on Kubernetes or similar orchestrators
- When zero downtime is required

**Advantages:** Zero downtime. Gradual rollout limits blast radius.
**Disadvantages:** Old and new versions run simultaneously (must be compatible).

### Blue-Green Deployment

Run two identical environments. Blue is production. Deploy to green. Switch traffic. Green becomes the new production.

**When to use:**
- When instant rollback is critical
- High-risk releases
- When you need to test in a production-like environment

**Advantages:** Instant rollback by switching traffic back.
**Disadvantages:** Requires double infrastructure. Database changes are tricky.

### Canary Deployment

Release to a small percentage of users first. Watch for problems. Gradually increase traffic.

```
Step 1: 5% of users see new version
Step 2: 25% of users see new version
Step 3: 50% of users see new version
Step 4: 100% of users see new version
```

**When to use:**
- High-traffic applications where bugs affect many users
- When you want real-world validation before full rollout
- A/B testing new features

**Advantages:** Real user testing with limited risk.
**Disadvantages:** Complex traffic routing. Need good monitoring to detect problems.

## Deployment Pipelines

Modern teams use automated pipelines to deploy. A pipeline is a series of steps that code passes through automatically.

### Why Automate Deployments?

**Manual deployments are risky:**
- Humans forget steps under pressure
- Different people do things differently
- Hard to repeat exactly the same way
- Slow and labor-intensive

**Automated deployments are reliable:**
- Same steps every time
- Fast and repeatable
- Can run any time, including weekends
- Detailed logs of what happened

## Deployment Artifacts

An artifact is the deployable unit - what actually gets deployed.

**Types of artifacts:**
- Container images (Docker)
- Compiled binaries
- Packaged applications (JAR, WAR, ZIP)
- Infrastructure code (Terraform, CloudFormation)

**Artifact best practices:**
- Build once, deploy everywhere (same artifact to all environments)
- Version all artifacts
- Store in artifact repositories (Docker Hub, Nexus, Artifactory)
- Never modify artifacts after building

## Rollback

Rollback is your safety net. When a deployment causes problems, rollback reverts to the previous working version.

**Rollback methods:**
- Redeploy the previous artifact version
- Switch traffic back (blue-green)
- Scale down new version, scale up old version (canary)

**Rollback requirements:**
- Keep previous versions available
- Database changes must be backward compatible
- Configuration must support both versions
- Practice rollbacks before you need them

## Deployment and DevOps

DevOps has transformed deployment:

### Traditional Deployment
- Releases every few months
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Manual, scripted processes
- Operations team deploys
- High stress, high risk

### DevOps Deployment
- Releases multiple times per day
- Any time, no maintenance windows needed
- Fully automated pipelines
- Developers deploy their own code
- Low stress, low risk (each change is small)

### Continuous Deployment

The ultimate DevOps goal: every code commit automatically deploys to production if all tests pass.

```
Commit → Build → Test → Deploy to Staging → Test → Deploy to Production
           ↓        ↓                         ↓
        Automated Automated              Automated
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Deploying on Fridays** - Problems discovered over the weekend are hard to fix with fewer people available.

2. **Skipping staging** - Production is not the place to find bugs. Always test in a production-like staging environment first.

3. **No rollback plan** - Hope is not a strategy. Know exactly how to revert before you deploy.

4. **Big bang releases** - Large releases have more risk. Small, frequent deployments are safer.

5. **Ignoring monitoring** - If you cannot see problems, you cannot fix them. Check dashboards after every deployment.

## Key Takeaways

- Deployment moves tested software to production where users access it
- Different strategies balance speed, safety, and complexity
- Blue-green enables instant rollback; canary limits blast radius
- Automated pipelines make deployments fast, reliable, and repeatable
- Always have a rollback plan and practice using it
- DevOps enables frequent, low-risk deployments instead of scary big releases

In the next lesson, you will learn about Maintenance and Operations, where teams keep deployed software running smoothly.
