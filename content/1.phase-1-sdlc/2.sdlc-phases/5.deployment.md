      correctAnswer: "Canary deployment"
      explanation: "Canary deployments release to a small portion of users first (like 5%). If problems appear, only that small group is affected. If everything works, traffic gradually increases to 100%."

# Deployment

Deployment is the process of making software available to users. After development and testing, the code moves to production servers where real people can use it. This phase is where all the previous work finally reaches its destination.

Deployment can be simple or complex depending on the application. A small website might copy files to a server. A large system might coordinate changes across dozens of services.

## What is Deployment?

Deployment takes tested, approved software and puts it where users can access it. This involves:

- Moving code to production servers
- Updating databases if needed
- Configuring environment settings
- Making the application accessible to users

## Deployment Environments

Software typically moves through several environments before reaching production:

- **Development**: Where developers build and test locally
- **Testing/QA**: Where QA teams verify the application
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final checks
- **Production**: Live environment serving real users

Each environment should be as similar to production as possible. Differences between environments cause surprises during deployment.

## Deployment Strategies

Different strategies balance speed, safety, and complexity. Choose based on your risk tolerance and technical capabilities.

### Big Bang Deployment

Replace the entire old system with the new version at once.

**Pros:** Simple to execute
**Cons:** High risk - if something breaks, everyone is affected

**Best for:** Small applications with low traffic

### Rolling Deployment

Update servers one at a time or in small groups.

**Pros:** Reduces risk, no downtime
**Cons:** Two versions run simultaneously during update

**Best for:** Applications that can handle mixed versions

### Blue-Green Deployment

Run two identical environments. Deploy to the inactive one, then switch traffic.

**Pros:** Instant rollback by switching back, zero downtime
**Cons:** Requires double infrastructure

**Best for:** Critical applications where downtime is unacceptable

### Canary Deployment

Release to a small percentage of users first, then gradually increase.

**Pros:** Problems affect few users, real-world testing
**Cons:** Requires traffic routing capabilities

**Best for:** High-traffic applications where you want to minimize blast radius

## Deployment Components

A deployment process typically includes these components:

### Build Artifacts

Code must be packaged for deployment. This might be:
- Compiled binaries
- Container images
- Bundled JavaScript files
- Deployment packages

### Configuration Management

Each environment needs specific settings:
- Database connection strings
- API keys and secrets
- Feature flags
- Resource limits

### Database Migrations

When the database structure changes:
- Add new tables or columns
- Modify existing schemas
- Migrate existing data
- Handle backward compatibility

## Deployment Best Practices

### Automate Everything

Manual deployments introduce human error. Scripts and pipelines ensure consistency.

### Deploy Small Changes Often

Small, frequent deployments are safer than large, rare ones. If something breaks, you know exactly what caused it.

### Always Have a Rollback Plan

Know how to return to the previous version quickly. Test your rollback procedure before you need it.

### Deploy During Low Traffic

When possible, deploy during periods of low usage. This reduces the number of users affected by any issues.

### Monitor After Deployment

Watch metrics and logs closely after deploying. Catch problems before users report them.

## Deployment in DevOps

DevOps transforms deployment from a stressful event to a routine activity:

- **Continuous Deployment** automatically deploys every change that passes tests
- **Infrastructure as Code** makes environments reproducible
- **Feature flags** separate deployment from release
- **Observability** provides visibility into deployment health

## Key Takeaways

- Deployment makes software available to users in production
- Different strategies (big bang, rolling, blue-green, canary) offer different risk profiles
- Moving through environments (dev, test, staging, production) catches issues early
- Automation and rollback plans are essential for safe deployments
- DevOps practices make deployment frequent and routine rather than rare and risky

In the next lesson, you will learn about Maintenance and Operations, where teams keep software running smoothly after deployment.
