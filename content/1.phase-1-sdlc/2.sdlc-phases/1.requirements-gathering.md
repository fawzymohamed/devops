    - question: "What is the main purpose of requirements gathering?"
      type: single

        - "To understand what the software needs to do before building it"

        - "To train users on how to use the system"
      correctAnswer: "To understand what the software needs to do before building it"
      explanation: "Requirements gathering happens before development starts. Its purpose is to clearly define what the software should do, who will use it, and what problems it will solve."

      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Users must be able to log in with email and password"
        - "The system must respond within 2 seconds"
        - "Users can search for products by name"
        - "The system must be available 99.9% of the time"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Users must be able to log in with email and password"
        - "Users can search for products by name"
      explanation: "Functional requirements describe what the system does - like logging in or searching. Response time and availability are non-functional requirements that describe how well the system performs."

    - question: "Stakeholders only include the people who will use the software."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Stakeholders include anyone affected by the project - users, business owners, managers, developers, support teams, and even regulators. All these groups may have requirements that need to be captured."

    - question: "What typically happens when teams skip proper requirements gathering?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "The project finishes faster with no problems"
        - "Teams build features nobody asked for or needs"
        - "Users are always happy with the result"
        - "Testing becomes unnecessary"
      correctAnswer: "Teams build features nobody asked for or needs"
      explanation: "Without proper requirements, teams guess what to build. They often create features users do not want while missing features users actually need. This leads to costly rework and unhappy stakeholders."

# Requirements Gathering

Requirements gathering is the first and most important phase of any software project. Before you write a single line of code, you need to know what you are building and why. Getting this wrong means building the wrong product.

Think of requirements like a blueprint for a house. Without clear plans, builders would not know how many rooms to build, where to put the windows, or how big the kitchen should be. Requirements serve the same purpose for software.

## What is Requirements Gathering?

Requirements gathering is the process of finding out what the software needs to do. You talk to the people who will use the system, the people paying for it, and the people who will maintain it. You document everything clearly so the development team knows exactly what to build.

## Types of Requirements

Software requirements fall into two main categories. Understanding both is essential for complete documentation.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe **what the system does**. These are the features and behaviors users can see and interact with.

Examples:
- Users can create an account with email and password
- The system sends order confirmations by email
- Administrators can view all user accounts
- Customers can filter products by price range

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how well the system works**. These are quality attributes that affect user experience.

Examples:
- Pages must load in under 3 seconds
- The system must handle 10,000 users at once
- Data must be backed up every hour
- The application must work on mobile devices

## Who Are Stakeholders?

Stakeholders are all the people who have an interest in the project. Each group has different needs that requirements must address.

- **End users** - People who will use the software daily
- **Business owners** - People paying for the project
- **Managers** - People responsible for business outcomes
- **Developers** - People who will build the system
- **Support teams** - People who will help users
- **Compliance officers** - People ensuring legal requirements are met

## Gathering Techniques

Different situations call for different techniques. Good requirements analysts use several methods together.

### Interviews

One-on-one conversations with stakeholders. Best for understanding detailed needs and concerns.

### Surveys

Written questionnaires sent to many people. Best for gathering input from large groups quickly.

### Workshops

Group sessions where stakeholders discuss needs together. Best for finding conflicts and building agreement.

### Observation

Watching users do their current work. Best for understanding real workflows and pain points.

### Document Analysis

Reading existing documents, reports, and systems. Best for understanding current processes and constraints.

## Writing Good Requirements

Good requirements share certain qualities:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Assuming you know what users want** - Always ask. Your assumptions are often wrong.

2. **Talking only to managers** - Include the people who actually do the daily work.

3. **Writing vague requirements** - "The system should be fast" is not specific enough.

4. **Ignoring non-functional requirements** - Performance and security matter as much as features.

5. **Not getting sign-off** - Document agreement before moving forward.

## Requirements in DevOps

In traditional Waterfall, requirements are gathered once at the start. In Agile and DevOps, requirements gathering is continuous:

- **User stories** capture requirements in small pieces
- **Sprint planning** reviews and refines requirements regularly
- **Feedback loops** bring new requirements from real user experience
- **Backlog grooming** keeps requirements updated and prioritized

## Key Takeaways

- Requirements gathering defines what to build before development starts
- Functional requirements describe what the system does; non-functional describe how well
- Multiple stakeholder groups have different needs to consider
- Use various techniques like interviews, surveys, and observation
- Poor requirements lead to building the wrong product

In the next lesson, you will learn about Design and Architecture, where requirements turn into technical plans for building the system.
