        - "Interviewing stakeholders"
        - "Observing users at work"
        - "Creating prototypes for feedback"
      explanation: "Interviews, observation, and prototyping are all valid techniques. Skipping documentation often leads to misunderstandings and project failure."

    - question: "Requirements should never change once they are written down."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Requirements often change as stakeholders learn more about what they need. Good teams manage change rather than fight it. This is especially true in Agile projects."

    - question: "What happens when teams skip or rush requirements gathering?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Projects finish faster and under budget"
        - "Teams build features users do not need or want"
        - "Code quality improves automatically"
        - "Testing becomes unnecessary"
      correctAnswer: "Teams build features users do not need or want"
      explanation: "Rushing requirements is a top cause of project failure. Teams end up building the wrong thing, leading to expensive rework or project cancellation."

# Requirements Gathering

Requirements gathering is the first and most important step in any software project. Before you write a single line of code, you need to understand what you are building and why. Get this wrong, and everything that follows will be wrong too.

Think of building software like building a house. You would not start laying bricks without knowing how many rooms the owner wants, where the doors should go, or how big the kitchen needs to be. Requirements gathering is where you ask all these questions.

## What is Requirements Gathering?

Requirements gathering is the process of finding out what a software system needs to do. You talk to users, watch how they work, study existing systems, and document everything the new software must accomplish.

The goal is simple: **understand the problem before solving it**.

## Why Requirements Gathering Matters

Studies show that fixing a bug found during requirements costs 10 to 100 times less than fixing the same bug after deployment. Bad requirements are the number one reason software projects fail.

**Real-world impact:**
- A bank spent $2 million on software that users refused to use because nobody asked what they actually needed
- A hospital system was scrapped after launch because it did not meet regulatory requirements that were never documented
- An e-commerce site had to be rebuilt because performance requirements were ignored

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**. They are specific actions or behaviors.

Examples:
- The system shall allow users to reset their password via email
- The checkout process shall calculate tax based on shipping address
- Users shall be able to filter products by price, category, and rating

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform**. They cover quality attributes.

Examples:
- The page shall load in under 2 seconds
- The system shall handle 10,000 concurrent users
- Data shall be encrypted at rest and in transit
- The system shall be available 99.9% of the time

### Business Requirements

Business requirements explain **why the project exists** and what business goals it supports.

Examples:
- Increase online sales by 25% in the next fiscal year
- Reduce customer support calls by automating common questions
- Enter the mobile market to reach younger customers

## Requirements Gathering Techniques

### 1. Stakeholder Interviews

Talk directly to people who will use or be affected by the system. Ask open-ended questions and listen carefully.

**Good questions to ask:**
- What problems do you face with the current system?
- What would make your job easier?
- What happens if this task is not completed on time?
- Who else should I talk to about this?

### 2. Observation

Watch users do their actual work. People often forget to mention steps that feel automatic to them.

Sit beside a customer service agent for a day. You will learn things no interview could reveal.

### 3. Document Analysis

Study existing documents: manuals, reports, forms, emails, and old system documentation. They contain hidden requirements.

### 4. Prototyping

Build a simple mock-up and show it to users. A picture is worth a thousand words. Users can react to something concrete more easily than to abstract descriptions.

### 5. Workshops

Bring stakeholders together in a room. Use whiteboards, sticky notes, and group exercises to build shared understanding.

### User Stories Format

In Agile teams, requirements are often written as user stories:

> "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

Example: "As a returning customer, I want to see my order history so that I can quickly reorder items I bought before."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Assuming you know what users need** - Always ask. Your assumptions are usually wrong.

2. **Talking only to managers** - Managers describe what they think happens. Front-line workers know what actually happens.

3. **Writing vague requirements** - "The system should be fast" is not testable. "Pages load in under 2 seconds" is.

4. **Ignoring non-functional requirements** - A feature that works but takes 30 seconds to load is still a failure.

5. **Treating requirements as fixed** - Requirements will change. Plan for it.

## Requirements and DevOps

In traditional development, requirements were gathered once at the start and rarely updated. DevOps changes this.

**DevOps practices for requirements:**
- Gather feedback continuously from production monitoring
- Use feature flags to test new requirements with real users
- Automate acceptance tests that verify requirements are met
- Keep requirements in version control alongside code

## Key Takeaways

- Requirements gathering happens before coding begins and continues throughout the project
- Functional requirements describe what the system does; non-functional describe how well it does it
- Use multiple techniques: interviews, observation, prototypes, and workshops
- Good requirements are clear, testable, complete, consistent, and prioritized
- Skipping this phase is the fastest path to project failure

In the next lesson, you will learn about Design and Architecture, where requirements are transformed into a plan for building the system.
