  questions:
    - question: "What is the main goal of the development phase?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To gather requirements from users"
        - "To turn designs into working, tested code"
        - "To deploy software to production"
        - "To monitor system performance"
      correctAnswer: "To turn designs into working, tested code"
      explanation: "The development phase transforms the design into actual working software. Developers write code, test it, and make sure it meets the requirements."

    - question: "Why are code reviews important?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "They slow down development intentionally"
        - "They help catch bugs early and share knowledge across the team"
        - "They are only needed for junior developers"
        - "They replace the need for testing"
      correctAnswer: "They help catch bugs early and share knowledge across the team"
      explanation: "Code reviews catch bugs before they reach production and help spread knowledge so no one person is the only expert. They are valuable for all developers, not just juniors."

    - question: "Select all characteristics of clean code."

        - "Easy to read and understand"
        - "Uses clever tricks to save lines"
        - "Has meaningful variable and function names"
        - "Includes comments that explain why, not what"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Easy to read and understand"
        - "Has meaningful variable and function names"
        - "Includes comments that explain why, not what"
      explanation: "Clean code is readable, uses clear names, and explains reasoning in comments. Clever tricks often make code harder to maintain and should be avoided."

    - question: "Developers should commit their code directly to the main branch without review."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Most teams use branches and require code review before merging to main. This protects the main branch from bugs and ensures quality."

    - question: "What does 'technical debt' mean?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "The cost of buying development tools"
        - "Shortcuts in code that will need fixing later"
        - "Money owed to technology vendors"
        - "The time spent learning new languages"
      correctAnswer: "Shortcuts in code that will need fixing later"
      explanation: "Technical debt is like borrowing against the future. Quick fixes and shortcuts work now but create extra work later. Too much debt slows development over time."

# Development/Coding

The development phase is where software comes to life. Designs that existed only on paper become running code. This is often the longest phase of the SDLC and involves the most people.

Writing code is only part of development. Good development includes planning how to work, reviewing each other's code, writing tests, and keeping the codebase healthy for future changes.

## What Happens During Development

Development transforms designs into working software through several activities:

### Setting Up the Environment

Before coding, developers need:
- A local development environment (IDE, runtime, dependencies)
- Access to version control repositories
- Connection to development databases or services
- Understanding of coding standards and conventions

### Writing Code

Developers translate design specifications into working code. They:
- Implement features piece by piece
- Write unit tests for their code
- Follow team coding standards
- Document complex logic

### Testing Locally

Before sharing code, developers test it on their own machines:
- Run unit tests to verify logic
- Manually test features in a browser or application
- Check that existing features still work

### Code Review

Other developers review the code before it enters the main codebase. They look for:
- Bugs and edge cases
- Clarity and maintainability
- Security issues
- Alignment with design

### Merging

Once approved, code is merged into the shared codebase. This triggers automated builds and tests.

## Version Control with Git

Version control is essential for team development. Git is the standard tool.

**Why version control matters:**
- Multiple developers can work on the same codebase
- Every change is tracked with who made it and why
- You can go back to any previous version
- Branches let developers work on features without affecting others

### Branching Strategy

Most teams use branches to organize work:

steps:
  - label: Main
    sublabel: Stable code
    icon: "\U0001F333"
    color: emerald
  - label: Branch
    sublabel: Create feature
    icon: "\U0001F33F"
    color: violet
  - label: Develop
    sublabel: Write code
    icon: "\U0001F4BB"
    color: blue
  - label: Review
    sublabel: PR approved
    icon: "\U0001F440"
    color: amber
  - label: Merge
    sublabel: Back to main

::

**Main branch:** Always contains working, tested code. This is what gets deployed.

**Feature branches:** Developers create a branch for each feature or bug fix. When done, they merge back to main.

### Commits

A commit is a snapshot of your changes. Good commits:
- Focus on one thing (one feature or one bug fix)
- Have clear messages explaining what and why
- Are small enough to review easily

**Good commit message:**
```
Add password reset email functionality

Users can now request a password reset link via email.
The link expires after 24 hours for security.

Closes #142
```

## Code Quality Practices

### Clean Code Principles

Clean code is easy to read, understand, and change. It:

items:
  - text: Uses meaningful names for variables and functions
    icon: "\U0001F3F7️"
  - text: Keeps functions short and focused

  - text: Handles errors gracefully
    icon: "\U0001F6E1️"
  - text: Has tests that verify behavior

### Naming Conventions

Names should explain what something is or does:

```javascript
// Bad
let x = 5;
function calc(a, b) { ... }

// Good
let retryAttempts = 5;
function calculateTotalPrice(items, taxRate) { ... }
```

### Comments

Write comments that explain **why**, not **what**. The code shows what happens; comments explain the reasoning.

```javascript
// Bad: Repeats what the code says
// Add 1 to counter
counter = counter + 1;

// Good: Explains why
// Retry once more since network requests occasionally timeout
counter = counter + 1;
```

### Code Reviews

Code reviews are one of the best ways to catch bugs and improve code quality.

**What reviewers look for:**
- Does the code do what it should?
- Are there any bugs or edge cases missed?
- Is it easy to understand?
- Does it follow team standards?
- Are there security concerns?

**Tips for good reviews:**
- Be kind and constructive
- Explain why something should change
- Praise good solutions, not just point out problems
- Review promptly so developers are not blocked

## Technical Debt

Technical debt is the cost of shortcuts. When teams rush, they often write code that works but is hard to maintain. This "debt" must be paid later through refactoring.

**Examples of technical debt:**
- Skipping tests to meet a deadline
- Copy-pasting code instead of creating shared functions
- Ignoring warnings and TODO comments
- Using temporary fixes that become permanent

**Managing technical debt:**
- Track it like bugs in your issue tracker
- Allocate time each sprint to pay it down
- Do not let it grow faster than you can repay

## Development and DevOps

Development practices directly affect DevOps success:

### Continuous Integration

Developers merge code frequently (at least daily). Each merge triggers automated builds and tests. This catches problems early when they are easy to fix.

### Automated Testing

Tests run automatically whenever code changes. Developers write:
- **Unit tests:** Test individual functions
- **Integration tests:** Test how components work together
- **End-to-end tests:** Test complete user flows

### Infrastructure as Code

Developers manage development environments using code:
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- Configuration files in version control
- Scripts to set up and tear down environments

### Feature Flags

New features hide behind flags. Developers can:
- Deploy code without enabling features
- Gradually roll out features to users
- Quickly disable features if problems appear

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Coding without a clear design** - Jumping straight to code leads to rework. Spend time understanding what to build first.

2. **Working in isolation too long** - Merge code frequently. Long-lived branches create painful merges.

3. **Skipping tests** - Tests take time upfront but save time overall. Bugs caught early are cheap to fix.

4. **Ignoring code review feedback** - Reviews improve code quality. Take feedback seriously.

5. **Not communicating blockers** - If you are stuck, ask for help. Silent struggle wastes time.

## Key Takeaways

- Development transforms design into working, tested code
- Version control (Git) is essential for team collaboration
- Clean code is readable, maintainable, and well-tested
- Code reviews catch bugs early and spread knowledge
- Technical debt accumulates when teams take shortcuts
- DevOps practices like CI and automated testing improve development quality

In the next lesson, you will learn about Testing and QA, where code is verified to meet requirements before deployment.
