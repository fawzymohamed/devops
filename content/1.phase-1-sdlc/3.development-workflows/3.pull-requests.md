        - "A request for more disk space"
      correctAnswer: "A request to merge your branch changes into another branch"
      explanation: "A pull request (PR) asks to merge changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into main. It provides a place for review and discussion."

        - "How to test the changes"
        - "Related ticket or issue numbers"
      explanation: "Good PR descriptions explain the what, why, and how of your changes. They link to related issues and provide testing instructions. Personal opinions are not appropriate."

        - "Never - always create regular pull requests"
        - "Only for documentation changes"
      correctAnswer: "When you want early feedback before the work is complete"
      explanation: "Draft PRs are perfect for getting early feedback on your approach, sharing work in progress, or signaling that you are working on something without asking for full review yet."

    - question: "Pull requests are only useful for code review."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Pull requests also serve as documentation of why changes were made, trigger CI/CD pipelines, enable discussion, and create a history of decisions for future reference."

    - question: "What should you do if your PR has merge conflicts?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Update your branch with the latest changes from the target branch and resolve conflicts"
        - "Ask someone else to fix it"
        - "Delete the PR and start over"
        - "Merge anyway and hope for the best"
      correctAnswer: "Update your branch with the latest changes from the target branch and resolve conflicts"
      explanation: "When conflicts arise, pull the latest target branch into your branch and resolve the conflicts. This is normal when multiple people work on the same codebase."

# Pull Requests

A pull request (PR) is how you propose merging your code changes into another branch. It is the bridge between finishing your work and getting it into the main codebase. Pull requests enable code review, trigger automated checks, and document why changes were made.

Most teams require all changes to go through pull requests. This ensures no code enters production without review.

## What is a Pull Request?

A pull request tells your team: "I finished working on something. Please review it and merge it when ready."

The name comes from the action: you are requesting that someone pull your changes into their branch.

## Creating a Pull Request

After pushing your branch to the remote repository, create a pull request through your platform (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

### Step by Step

```bash
# Finish your work and push to remote
git push origin feature/add-search

# Then go to your repository's website
# Click "Create Pull Request" or "New Pull Request"
# Select your branch and the target branch (usually main)
# Fill in the description
# Click "Create"
```

## Writing a Good Description

The description is your chance to explain your work. Help reviewers understand what they are looking at.

### Example Description

```markdown
## Summary
Add search functionality to the products page.

## Why
Users currently scroll through hundreds of products to find what they want.
Search was the #1 requested feature in our last user survey.

## Changes
- Added search input component
- Created search API endpoint
- Added debounce to prevent excessive API calls
- Included unit tests for the search logic

## How to Test
1. Go to /products
2. Type in the search box
3. Results should filter as you type
4. Empty search should show all products

## Screenshots
[Before and after screenshots here]

## Related Issues
Closes #234
```

## Pull Request Best Practices

### Keep PRs Small

Small pull requests get reviewed faster and better. Aim for changes you can review in 30 minutes or less.

**Instead of:** One PR with 50 files and 2000 lines

**Better:** Five PRs with 10 files and 400 lines each

### One Purpose Per PR

Each PR should do one thing. Mixing unrelated changes makes review confusing and increases risk.

**Bad:** "Add search feature and fix login bug and update styles"

**Good:** "Add search feature" (separate PR for the bug fix)

### Write Clear Commit Messages

Your commits tell the story of how you built the feature. Good commits help reviewers follow your thinking.

```bash
# Bad commit messages
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "stuff"
git commit -m "wip"

# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add search input component"
git commit -m "Connect search to API endpoint"
git commit -m "Add debounce to search input"
```

### Self-Review First

Before requesting review, review your own PR. You will often catch mistakes you missed while coding.

- Read through every changed file
- Check that you did not leave debug code
- Verify tests pass locally
- Make sure the description is complete

## Draft Pull Requests

Draft PRs signal that work is in progress. Use them to:

- Get early feedback on your approach
- Show teammates what you are working on
- Trigger CI checks while still developing
- Start a discussion before finishing

Convert to a regular PR when you are ready for review.

## Handling Feedback

footnote: Treat feedback as collaboration, not criticism

### Address All Comments

Respond to every comment, even if just to say "Done" or "Good catch, fixed." This shows you read and considered the feedback.

### Request Re-review

After making changes, re-request review so reviewers know you addressed their feedback.

### Resolve Conversations

Mark discussions as resolved when addressed. This helps everyone track what still needs attention.

## Merge Options

Most platforms offer several merge strategies:

| Strategy | What It Does | Best For |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Merge commit** | Creates a merge commit preserving all commits | Default, keeps full history |
| **Squash and merge** | Combines all commits into one | Clean history, many small commits |
| **Rebase and merge** | Adds commits directly without merge commit | Linear history |

Choose based on your team's preferences. Many teams use squash for feature branches to keep main clean.

## Automated Checks

Modern pull requests trigger automated checks:

- **CI Pipeline** - Runs tests automatically
- **Linters** - Check code style
- **Security scans** - Look for vulnerabilities
- **Build checks** - Verify the code compiles

Most teams require these checks to pass before merging.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions check
name: PR Checks
on: pull_request
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

## Pull Request as Documentation

PRs create a permanent record of why changes were made. Months later, someone can search the PR history to understand:

- Why this feature exists
- What alternatives were considered
- What problems came up during review
- Who was involved in the decision

Write your PR knowing future developers will read it.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No description** - A PR with no explanation wastes reviewer time

2. **Giant PRs** - Big changes are hard to review and risky to merge

3. **Mixing concerns** - Combining unrelated changes in one PR

4. **Ignoring CI failures** - Fix failing checks before requesting review

5. **Stale PRs** - Letting PRs sit open too long creates merge conflicts

6. **Force pushing after review** - This can lose reviewer comments and cause confusion

## Key Takeaways

- Pull requests are how you propose merging changes into another branch
- Write clear descriptions explaining what, why, and how to test
- Keep PRs small and focused on one purpose
- Use draft PRs for early feedback on work in progress
- Address all feedback and re-request review after making changes
- PRs serve as documentation for future developers
