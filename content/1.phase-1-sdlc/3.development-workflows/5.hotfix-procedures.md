        - "An urgent fix applied directly to production to resolve a critical issue"
        - "A regular feature that was requested by users"

        - "A code refactoring effort"
      correctAnswer: "An urgent fix applied directly to production to resolve a critical issue"
      explanation: "A hotfix is an emergency patch that fixes a critical production problem. It bypasses the normal development cycle because the issue is too urgent to wait."

      options:
        - "When a production issue is causing significant user or business impact"
        - "When you want to add a new feature quickly"

        - "When the code is simple enough to skip review"
      correctAnswer: "When a production issue is causing significant user or business impact"
      explanation: "Hotfixes are for emergencies - when users cannot complete critical actions, when security is compromised, or when the business is losing money. Normal features use the normal process."

      correctAnswers:
        - "Create a branch from production, not from development"
        - "Keep the fix as small as possible"
        - "Document what was changed and why"
      explanation: "Hotfix branches come from production to avoid including unfinished work. Keep changes minimal to reduce risk. Always document. Never skip testing - even abbreviated testing is essential."

    - question: "After deploying a hotfix to production, you should merge it back to the development branch."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: true
      explanation: "This is true. After a hotfix goes to production, merge it back to development (and any other active branches). Otherwise, the fix will be lost when the next regular release deploys."

      options:
        - "Conduct a post-incident review to prevent similar issues"
        - "Immediately start working on new features"
        - "Delete all records of the incident"
        - "Blame the developer who caused the bug"
      correctAnswer: "Conduct a post-incident review to prevent similar issues"
      explanation: "Post-incident reviews (blameless post-mortems) help teams learn. The goal is to understand what happened and prevent it from happening again, not to assign blame."

# Hotfix Procedures

A hotfix is an emergency repair to production software. Something is broken, users are affected, and you need to fix it now. The normal development process takes too long.

Hotfixes require speed, but rushing causes mistakes. A structured process helps you move fast without making things worse.

## What is a Hotfix?

A hotfix is a rapid change to production code to fix a critical bug. It bypasses the normal release schedule because the problem cannot wait.

## When to Use a Hotfix

Not every bug deserves a hotfix. Reserve them for truly critical issues:

### Hotfix-Worthy Issues

- **Security vulnerabilities** - Exposed data, authentication bypass
- **Complete feature failure** - Users cannot log in, checkout, or complete core tasks
- **Data corruption** - System is damaging user data
- **Significant revenue loss** - Every hour costs substantial money
- **Compliance violations** - Breaking legal requirements

### Not Hotfix-Worthy

- Minor visual bugs
- Performance issues that are annoying but not blocking
- Features working differently than expected (but still working)
- Issues affecting small number of users with workarounds

**When in doubt:** Ask "Can this wait for the next scheduled release?" If yes, it is not a hotfix.

### Step 1: Detect and Assess

When an issue is reported:

1. **Verify the problem** - Can you reproduce it? Is it really happening?
2. **Assess impact** - How many users? How critical?
3. **Decide severity** - Does this need a hotfix or can it wait?

### Step 2: Create Hotfix Branch

Branch from production (usually `main`), not from development:

```bash
# Get the latest production code
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-login-crash

# Naming convention: hotfix/short-description
```

**Why branch from production?** The development branch may have unfinished features. You want to fix only the production issue, nothing else.

### Step 3: Make the Fix

Keep the change as small as possible. Fix the bug and nothing else.

**Good hotfix:**
```diff
- if (user.isActive) {
+ if (user && user.isActive) {
```

**Bad hotfix:**
```diff
- if (user.isActive) {
+ if (user && user.isActive) {
+ // Also refactored this entire file
+ // And added a new feature
+ // And updated the logging format
```

Resist the temptation to fix "one more thing." Every extra change increases risk.

### Step 4: Test the Fix

Even under pressure, test your fix:

### Step 5: Deploy to Production

Follow your deployment process, even if abbreviated:

```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/fix-login-crash
git push origin main

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix: Fix login crash"
git push origin v1.2.1

# Deploy (your process here)
```

### Step 6: Merge Back to Development

**Critical step that teams often forget!**

After deploying, merge the hotfix into your development branch:

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/fix-login-crash
git push origin develop

# Clean up
git branch -d hotfix/fix-login-crash
git push origin --delete hotfix/fix-login-crash
```

If you skip this, the bug will reappear in your next regular release.

## During the Incident

### Communication

Keep stakeholders informed:

- **Technical team** - What is broken, who is fixing it
- **Support team** - What to tell users, workarounds if any
- **Management** - Impact, estimated time to fix
- **Users** (if appropriate) - Status page update

### Document as You Go

Write down:
- What time the issue started
- What the symptoms are
- What you tried
- What worked

You will need this for the post-incident review.

## After the Hotfix

### Verify the Fix

Monitor production after deployment:

- Is the error rate dropping?
- Are users able to complete the affected action?
- Any new errors appearing?

### Post-Incident Review

Within a few days, conduct a **blameless post-mortem**:

1. **What happened?** - Timeline of events
2. **Why did it happen?** - Root cause analysis
3. **How did we respond?** - What went well, what did not
4. **How do we prevent this?** - Action items

The goal is learning, not blaming. Anyone can introduce a bug. Good teams learn from incidents.

## Hotfix Anti-Patterns

Mistakes that make hotfixes worse:

### 1. Panic Changes

Making multiple changes at once because you are stressed. Fix one thing, verify it works, then move on.

### 2. Skipping Tests Entirely

"There is no time to test" leads to needing another hotfix to fix the hotfix.

### 3. Forgetting to Merge Back

The same bug reappears in the next release. Now you have the incident twice.

### 4. Too Many Hotfixes

If you need hotfixes frequently, your regular process is broken. Fix the process.

### 5. Expanding Scope

"While we are in here, let's also..." No. Fix the emergency. Everything else waits.

## Reducing Hotfix Needs

The best hotfix is one you never need:

- **Better testing** - Catch bugs before production
- **Feature flags** - Disable broken features without deployment
- **Canary releases** - Find problems before full rollout
- **Monitoring** - Detect issues quickly
- **Code review** - Fresh eyes catch bugs
- **Staging environments** - Test in production-like conditions

## Hotfixes in DevOps

DevOps practices make hotfixes safer:

- **Automated pipelines** - Even hotfixes go through CI/CD
- **Infrastructure as code** - Rollback is simple
- **Feature flags** - Disable broken code without deployment
- **Monitoring** - Know immediately if the fix works
- **Runbooks** - Documented procedures for common issues

## Key Takeaways

- Hotfixes are emergency fixes for critical production issues
- Reserve hotfixes for security issues, total failures, and major business impact
- Branch from production, make minimal changes, test even if abbreviated
- Always merge hotfixes back to development branches
- Conduct blameless post-mortems to prevent future incidents
- Invest in practices that reduce the need for hotfixes
