## Branch Naming Conventions

| Prefix | Use For | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New features | `feature/shopping-cart` |
| `bugfix/` | Bug fixes | `bugfix/login-error` |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fixes | `hotfix/payment-crash` |
| `refactor/` | Code improvements | `refactor/cleanup-api` |
| `docs/` | Documentation | `docs/api-guide` |

## Essential Git Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git checkout -b feature/name` | Create and switch to feature branch |
| `git push -u origin feature/name` | Push branch to remote |
| `git merge main` | Update branch with latest main |
| `git branch -d feature/name` | Delete local merged branch |
| `git push origin --delete feature/name` | Delete remote branch |

## Code Review Checklist

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| ✅ Correctness | Does the code work correctly? |
| 🧠 Readability | Is the logic easy to understand? |
| 🚧 Edge Cases | Are all edge cases handled? |
| 📏 Standards | Does it follow team conventions? |
| 🔐 Security | Any security concerns? |
| ⚠️ Errors | Is there adequate error handling? |

## PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
What does this PR do?

## Why
What problem does it solve?

## How to Test
1. Step one
2. Step two

## Related Issues
Closes #123
```

## PR Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep under 400 lines | Create giant PRs |
| One purpose per PR | Mix unrelated changes |
| Self-review before requesting | Submit without checking |
| Write clear commit messages | Use vague "fix" or "wip" |
| Address all feedback | Ignore reviewer comments |

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

| MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH | When to Increment |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) | Breaking changes |
| **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) | New features (backward compatible) |
| **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) | Bug fixes |

## Release Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Alpha** | Early, unstable, internal testing |
| **Beta** | Feature complete, bugs expected |
| **RC** | Release candidate, final testing |
| **GA** | General availability, stable |

## Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works | Best For |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Big Bang** | Replace all at once | Small apps, maintenance windows |
| **Rolling** | Update servers one by one | Zero-downtime web apps |
| **Blue-Green** | Two identical environments, switch traffic | Fast rollback needs |
| **Canary** | Release to small % first, gradually increase | High-risk changes |
| **Feature Flags** | Deploy code hidden behind flags | Gradual rollouts, A/B testing |

## Hotfix Decision Guide

**Use Hotfix When:**
- Security vulnerability exposed
- Users cannot complete core tasks
- Data corruption occurring
- Significant revenue loss
- Compliance violation

**Use Normal Release When:**
- Minor visual bugs
- Annoying but non-blocking issues
- Features work differently than expected
- Workarounds exist

## Hotfix Process

```bash
# 1. Branch from production
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-critical-bug

# 2. Make minimal fix, test, deploy

# 3. Merge back to develop (DON'T FORGET!)
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/fix-critical-bug
git push origin develop
```

## Merge Strategies

| Strategy | What It Does | Best For |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Merge commit** | Preserves all commits | Full history |
| **Squash and merge** | Combines into one commit | Clean main branch |
| **Rebase and merge** | Linear history, no merge commit | Simple history |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Area | Mistake | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Branches** | Working on main directly | Always create a branch |
| **Branches** | Long-lived feature branches | Keep under 2 weeks |
| **Reviews** | Rubber stamping | Actually read the code |
| **PRs** | No description | Explain what, why, how |
| **Releases** | No rollback plan | Document rollback steps |
| **Hotfixes** | Expanding scope | Fix only the emergency |
| **Hotfixes** | Forgetting merge back | Always merge to develop |

## Environment Progression

```
Development → Integration → Staging → Production
```

## Quick Reference: Branch Lifecycle

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1. **Create** | `git checkout -b feature/name` | Branch from main |
| 2. **Develop** | Write code, commit often | Make your changes |
| 3. **Push** | `git push -u origin feature/name` | Push to remote |
| 4. **PR** | Create pull request | Request code review |
| 5. **Merge** | Squash/merge to main | After approval |
| 6. **Delete** | `git branch -d feature/name` | Clean up branch |
