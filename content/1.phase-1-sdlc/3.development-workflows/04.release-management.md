        - "To deliver software to users safely and reliably"
        - "To write more code faster"
        - "To eliminate all testing"
        - "To reduce the number of developers needed"
      correctAnswer: "To deliver software to users safely and reliably"
      explanation: "Release management ensures that software reaches users in a controlled, safe way. It minimizes risk while delivering value consistently."

    - question: "In Semantic Versioning (1.2.3), what does incrementing the first number mean?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "There are breaking changes that may require user action"
        - "A bug was fixed"
        - "A new feature was added"
        - "The documentation was updated"
      correctAnswer: "There are breaking changes that may require user action"
      explanation: "In SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), the first number is MAJOR. It increments when there are breaking changes - changes that might break existing code or require users to change how they use the software."

    - question: "Select all common deployment strategies."

      options:
        - "Blue-green deployment"
        - "Canary release"

      correctAnswers:
        - "Blue-green deployment"
        - "Canary release"
        - "Rolling update"
      explanation: "Blue-green, canary, and rolling are all proven deployment strategies. Random deployment is not a real strategy - releases should always be controlled and intentional."

    - question: "A release candidate (RC) is a version that is ready for all users immediately."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. A release candidate is a version that is potentially ready for release but needs final testing. If no critical issues are found, it becomes the official release."

    - question: "What is the purpose of a staging environment?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To test releases in a production-like setting before going live"
        - "To store old code that is no longer used"
        - "To train new developers"
        - "To run marketing campaigns"
      correctAnswer: "To test releases in a production-like setting before going live"
      explanation: "Staging mirrors production as closely as possible. Testing here catches issues that would not appear in development but would cause problems for real users."

# Release Management

Release management is the process of planning, building, testing, and deploying software releases. It answers critical questions: What goes into this release? When does it ship? How do we ensure it works?

Good release management reduces risk, improves quality, and helps teams deliver value consistently.

## What is Release Management?

Release management covers everything from deciding what features go into a release to monitoring the software after deployment. It connects development work to user value.

## Why Release Management Matters

### Reduce Risk

Uncontrolled releases cause outages. Release management adds checkpoints that catch problems before they reach users.

### Coordinate Teams

Releases involve developers, testers, operations, and sometimes marketing. Release management keeps everyone aligned.

### Track Changes

Knowing exactly what changed in each release helps debug problems and satisfy compliance requirements.

### Build Confidence

Teams that release safely and often build trust with users and stakeholders.

## Version Numbering

Versions help everyone know which release they are using and what changed.

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

The most common versioning system uses three numbers: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

| Part | When to Increment | Example |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes | 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 |
| **MINOR** | New features (backward compatible) | 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes (backward compatible) | 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 |

**Example progression:**
- 1.0.0 - Initial release
- 1.0.1 - Bug fix
- 1.1.0 - New feature added
- 1.2.0 - Another feature
- 2.0.0 - Breaking API change

### Calendar Versioning (CalVer)

Some projects use dates instead: **YEAR.MONTH** or **YEAR.MONTH.DAY**

- Ubuntu: 22.04 (April 2022), 23.10 (October 2023)
- Good for projects with regular release schedules

### Build Numbers

CI systems often add build numbers: **1.2.3+456** where 456 is the build number.

::

### Alpha

Very early version. Missing features, many bugs. Used for internal testing only.

### Beta

Feature complete but still has bugs. Sometimes released to adventurous users who want early access and provide feedback.

### Release Candidate (RC)

Potentially the final version. No known critical bugs. If testing finds no issues, this becomes the official release.

### General Availability (GA)

The official public release. Stable, tested, and supported.

## Environment Stages

Software typically moves through several environments before reaching users:

```
Development -> Integration -> Staging -> Production
```

### Development

Where developers write and test code locally. Unstable by nature.

### Integration

Where code from multiple developers comes together. Integration tests run here.

### Staging

Mirrors production as closely as possible. Final testing before release. Same data structure, same configuration, same scale (ideally).

### Production

Where real users access the software. Changes here affect everyone.

## Deployment Strategies

How you deploy matters as much as what you deploy.

### Big Bang Deployment

Replace everything at once. Simple but risky. If something breaks, everyone is affected.

**When to use:** Small applications, scheduled maintenance windows, when rollback is simple.

### Rolling Update

Update servers one at a time. Some servers run the old version while others run the new version.

**When to use:** Most web applications, when you need zero downtime.

### Blue-Green Deployment

Run two identical environments. Blue runs current production. Green runs the new version. When ready, switch traffic from Blue to Green.

**Benefits:**
- Instant rollback - just switch back to Blue
- Zero downtime
- Easy to verify Green works before switching

**When to use:** When you need fast rollback, critical applications.

### Canary Release

Release to a small percentage of users first. Monitor for problems. Gradually increase traffic if everything looks good.

**Example:** Release to 1% of users. If no errors, increase to 10%, then 50%, then 100%.

**When to use:** High-risk changes, when you want real user feedback before full rollout.

### Feature Flags

Deploy code but hide features behind flags. Enable features for specific users or percentages without deploying new code.

```javascript
if (featureFlags.newCheckout) {
  showNewCheckout();
} else {
  showOldCheckout();
}
```

**When to use:** Continuous deployment, A/B testing, gradual feature rollout.

## Release Notes

Release notes tell users what changed. Good release notes include:

- New features
- Bug fixes
- Breaking changes (highlighted clearly)
- Upgrade instructions if needed
- Known issues

```markdown
## Version 2.1.0 - January 15, 2024

### New Features
- Added search functionality to products page
- Users can now export reports as PDF

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed login timeout issue (#234)
- Corrected currency display in checkout

### Breaking Changes
- API endpoint /api/users renamed to /api/v2/users
- Node 16 is now minimum required version
```

## Release Management in DevOps

DevOps transforms release management through automation:

- **Continuous Integration** - Every commit triggers automated tests
- **Continuous Delivery** - Every passing build is deployable
- **Continuous Deployment** - Passing builds deploy automatically
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Environments are reproducible
- **Monitoring** - Catch problems immediately after deployment

Teams that automate release management can deploy multiple times per day safely.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No rollback plan** - Always know how to undo a release

2. **Skipping staging** - Production surprises are expensive

3. **Friday deployments** - Avoid releasing before weekends

4. **No release notes** - Users and support teams need to know what changed

5. **Manual processes** - Automate everything you can

6. **Ignoring monitoring** - Watch closely after every release

## Key Takeaways

- Release management ensures software reaches users safely and reliably
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to communicate change scope
- Test in staging environments that mirror production
- Choose deployment strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary) based on risk tolerance
- Automate testing, deployment, and monitoring
- Always have a rollback plan
