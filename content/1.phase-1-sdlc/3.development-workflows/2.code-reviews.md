        - "To catch bugs and improve code quality before merging"

        - "To replace automated testing"
      correctAnswer: "To catch bugs and improve code quality before merging"
      explanation: "Code reviews help teams catch problems early, share knowledge, and maintain consistent code quality. They are about improving the code, not judging the developer."

      correctAnswers:
        - "Logic errors and potential bugs"

        - "Security vulnerabilities"
      explanation: "Good reviews check for correctness, readability, and security. How fast someone types is not relevant to code quality."

        - "Only if you wrote the original code"
        - "After waiting at least one week"
      correctAnswer: "When the code meets team standards and works correctly"
      explanation: "Approve when you are confident the code is correct, readable, follows team standards, and will not cause problems. Do not approve just to be friendly or because time passed."

    - question: "Code reviews are only useful for finding bugs in code."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Code reviews also spread knowledge across the team, ensure code follows standards, mentor junior developers, and catch security issues. Bug finding is just one benefit."

    - question: "What is the best way to give feedback in a code review?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Focus on the code, not the person, and explain why"
        - "Use sarcasm to make your point memorable"
        - "Only leave negative comments to save time"
        - "Write as few words as possible"
      correctAnswer: "Focus on the code, not the person, and explain why"
      explanation: "Good feedback is about the code, not the author. Explain why something should change. This helps the author learn and makes feedback easier to accept."

# Code Reviews

Code reviews happen when one developer examines code written by another before it merges into the main codebase. A fresh pair of eyes catches bugs, improves code quality, and spreads knowledge across the team.

Studies show that code reviews find 60% of defects. They are one of the most effective ways to improve software quality.

## What is a Code Review?

A code review is a systematic examination of code changes. The reviewer reads through the changes, looks for problems, and provides feedback. The author then addresses the feedback before the code merges.

## Why Code Reviews Matter

### Catch Bugs Early

Bugs found during review cost far less to fix than bugs found in production. A reviewer might spot a logic error, edge case, or typo that the author missed.

### Share Knowledge

Reviews spread understanding across the team. When you review code for a part of the system you do not know well, you learn how it works. When your code gets reviewed, you learn from your teammates' suggestions.

### Maintain Standards

Reviews ensure everyone follows the team's coding standards. Consistent code is easier to read, maintain, and debug.

### Mentor and Grow

Junior developers learn from senior developers' feedback. Senior developers stay sharp by explaining their reasoning. Everyone improves.

### Correctness

Does the code do what it is supposed to do? Follow the logic step by step. Think about what happens with different inputs.

### Readability

Can you understand the code quickly? Clear code needs fewer comments. Confusing code causes bugs later.

### Edge Cases

What happens when the list is empty? When the user enters nothing? When the network fails? Good code handles unexpected situations.

### Security

Is user input validated? Are passwords stored safely? Could this code allow unauthorized access?

### Performance

Will this code run slowly with large data sets? Are there unnecessary database queries or network calls?

## Giving Good Feedback

### Be Kind and Constructive

Remember a human wrote this code. Criticize the code, not the person.

**Instead of:** "This is wrong."

**Say:** "This might cause an issue when the list is empty. Consider adding a check for that case."

### Explain Why

Do not just say what to change. Explain why. This helps the author learn and make better decisions in the future.

**Instead of:** "Use a constant here."

**Say:** "Consider using a constant here. If this value changes later, you only need to update it in one place."

### Ask Questions

If you are not sure about something, ask. The author might have a good reason you do not see.

"I am curious why you chose this approach instead of X. Is there something I am missing?"

### Praise Good Work

When you see something clever, clean, or well-done, say so. Positive feedback encourages good practices.

"Nice solution! This is much cleaner than how we handled this before."

## Receiving Feedback

### Stay Open

Feedback is about the code, not about you. Even harsh feedback usually contains something useful.

### Ask for Clarification

If you do not understand a comment, ask. Do not guess what the reviewer meant.

### Explain Your Reasoning

If you disagree with feedback, explain why you made your choice. Maybe you have context the reviewer lacks. Maybe they will convince you. Either way, the discussion helps.

### Say Thank You

Reviewers spend their time helping you improve your code. A simple "thanks for the feedback" goes a long way.

### Small Changes Review Better

Studies show that reviewers find more bugs in smaller changes. After reviewing 400 lines, attention drops sharply. Aim for small, focused changes that take 30-60 minutes to review.

### Review Promptly

Waiting for reviews blocks progress. Try to review within 24 hours. If you are too busy, let the author know when you can review.

## Common Review Patterns

### Two-Pass Review

1. **First pass:** Skim for overall structure and approach
2. **Second pass:** Read carefully for details and bugs

### Start with Tests

Read the tests first. They explain what the code should do. Then read the implementation to see if it matches.

### Run the Code

If possible, pull the branch and run the code locally. Seeing it work (or fail) is better than just reading.

## Code Review Anti-Patterns

Things to avoid during reviews:

1. **Nitpicking** - Focusing only on tiny style issues while ignoring bigger problems

2. **Rubber stamping** - Approving without really reviewing

3. **Gate-keeping** - Blocking merges over personal preferences, not real issues

4. **Delay** - Letting reviews sit for days without response

5. **Hostility** - Making the author feel attacked rather than helped

## Code Reviews in DevOps

In DevOps teams, code reviews connect to automation:

- **Pull requests** trigger automated checks before human review
- **CI pipelines** run tests automatically when you push changes
- **Linters** catch style issues so reviewers can focus on logic
- **Required approvals** ensure no code merges without review

## Key Takeaways

- Code reviews catch bugs early and spread knowledge across the team
- Look for correctness, readability, edge cases, and security
- Give feedback that is kind, constructive, and explains why
- Keep reviews small (under 400 lines) for better feedback
- Review promptly to keep the team moving

In the next lesson, you will learn about Pull Requests, the mechanism that makes code reviews possible in modern development workflows.
