        - "To backup the repository"
      correctAnswer: "To develop new features in isolation from the main codebase"
      explanation: "Feature branches let developers work on new features without affecting the stable main branch. This isolation protects the team from incomplete or buggy code."

        - "branch1"
      correctAnswer: "feature/add-user-login"
      explanation: "Good branch names include a prefix (feature/, bugfix/, etc.) and a clear description of what the branch contains. This helps teams understand what each branch is for."

      correctAnswers:
        - "Developers can work on multiple features at the same time"
        - "The main branch stays stable and deployable"
        - "Code reviews become easier to manage"
      explanation: "Feature branches enable parallel development, protect the main branch, and make code reviews focused on specific changes. Testing is still required for all code."

    - question: "Feature branches should be kept open for months to collect as many changes as possible."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Long-lived feature branches create merge conflicts and integration problems. Keep branches short-lived and merge them frequently to avoid these issues."

    - question: "What should you do before merging a feature branch back to main?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Update your branch with the latest changes from main"
        - "Delete all your commit history"
        - "Rename the branch to 'completed'"
        - "Create a new repository"
      correctAnswer: "Update your branch with the latest changes from main"
      explanation: "Before merging, pull the latest changes from main into your feature branch. This ensures your code works with the current state of the project and reduces merge conflicts."

# Feature Branching

Feature branching is a workflow where developers create separate branches to build new features. Each feature gets its own branch, isolated from the main codebase. When the feature is ready, the branch merges back into main.

This simple idea solves a big problem: how do multiple developers work on the same codebase without stepping on each other's toes?

## What is Feature Branching?

A feature branch is a copy of your main codebase where you can make changes freely. Your work stays separate until you decide to merge it back. Think of it like a sandbox where you can experiment without breaking the playground.

## Why Use Feature Branches?

### Isolation

Your unfinished code does not affect others. You can commit broken code, experiment, and make mistakes without disrupting the team.

### Parallel Development

Multiple developers can work on different features at the same time. One person builds the login page while another builds the shopping cart. Their work never collides until merge time.

### Code Review

Feature branches make code reviews natural. When you finish a feature, you create a pull request. Teammates review just that feature, not a mix of unrelated changes.

### Easy Rollback

If a feature causes problems after merging, you can easily identify and revert those specific changes.

## Creating a Feature Branch

Here is how to create and use a feature branch:

```bash
# Start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-user-profile

# Work on your feature, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add user profile page layout"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin feature/add-user-profile
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

Good names help teams understand what each branch contains. Use these prefixes:

| Prefix | Use For | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New features | `feature/shopping-cart` |
| `bugfix/` | Bug fixes | `bugfix/login-error` |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fixes | `hotfix/payment-crash` |
| `refactor/` | Code improvements | `refactor/cleanup-api` |
| `docs/` | Documentation | `docs/api-guide` |

## Keeping Your Branch Updated

While you work on your feature, teammates merge other changes to main. Your branch falls behind. To avoid painful merge conflicts later, update your branch regularly:

```bash
# Get latest changes from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Switch back to your feature branch
git checkout feature/add-user-profile

# Merge main into your branch
git merge main

# Or use rebase for cleaner history
git rebase main
```

## When to Merge

Merge your feature branch when:

1. **The feature is complete** - All requirements are met
2. **Tests pass** - Your code works as expected
3. **Code review is approved** - Teammates have reviewed and approved
4. **No merge conflicts** - You have resolved any conflicts with main

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Working directly on main** - Always create a branch, even for small changes

2. **Giant branches** - Break large features into smaller branches that can merge independently

3. **Ignoring main updates** - Sync with main regularly to catch conflicts early

4. **Vague branch names** - Use clear names that describe the work

5. **Forgetting to delete merged branches** - Clean up after merging to keep the repository tidy

```bash
# Delete a merged branch locally
git branch -d feature/add-user-profile

# Delete from remote
git push origin --delete feature/add-user-profile
```

## Feature Branching in DevOps

Feature branching connects directly to DevOps practices:

- **CI pipelines** run automatically when you push to a branch
- **Automated tests** verify your feature works before merging
- **Preview environments** let you test features in isolation
- **Pull requests** trigger code reviews and quality checks

## Key Takeaways

- Feature branches let you develop in isolation from the main codebase
- Use consistent naming conventions like `feature/description`
- Keep branches short-lived to avoid merge conflicts
- Update your branch regularly from main
- Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean

In the next lesson, you will learn about Code Reviews, where teammates examine your branch changes before they merge into main.
