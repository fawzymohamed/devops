  questions:
    - question: "Who owns the product backlog?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "The development team"
        - "The Scrum Master"
        - "The Product Owner"
        - "The project manager"
      correctAnswer: "The Product Owner"
      explanation: "The Product Owner is responsible for the product backlog. They prioritize items, ensure clarity, and make decisions about what gets built. The team helps refine items, but the Product Owner owns the backlog."

    - question: "Select all characteristics of a healthy product backlog."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Top items are refined and ready for sprint planning"
        - "All items have detailed technical specifications"
        - "Items are ordered by priority"
        - "The backlog is reviewed and updated regularly"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Top items are refined and ready for sprint planning"
        - "Items are ordered by priority"
        - "The backlog is reviewed and updated regularly"
      explanation: "A healthy backlog has refined top items, clear priorities, and regular updates. Detailed technical specifications are NOT needed - stories should describe user needs, and the team decides technical details during development."

    - question: "Backlog refinement should only happen during sprint planning."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Backlog refinement is an ongoing activity that happens throughout the sprint, not just during planning. Teams typically spend 5-10% of their time on refinement to keep the backlog healthy."

    - question: "What does the MoSCoW prioritization method stand for?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Minimum, Standard, Critical, Wishlist"
        - "Must have, Should have, Could have, Will not have"
        - "Major, Secondary, Conditional, Waiting"
        - "Mandatory, Suggested, Conditional, Wanted"
      correctAnswer: "Must have, Should have, Could have, Will not have"
      explanation: "MoSCoW is a prioritization technique: Must have (essential), Should have (important), Could have (nice to have), and Will not have (out of scope). It helps teams focus on what truly matters."

    - question: "What is the purpose of backlog grooming sessions?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To assign tasks to specific developers"
        - "To prepare stories for upcoming sprints"
        - "To review completed work with stakeholders"
        - "To measure team performance"
      correctAnswer: "To prepare stories for upcoming sprints"
      explanation: "Backlog grooming (refinement) prepares upcoming stories by clarifying requirements, splitting large items, adding acceptance criteria, and estimating effort. This ensures stories are ready when sprint planning arrives."

# Backlog Management

The product backlog is the heart of Agile development. It contains everything the team might build, ordered by priority. A well-managed backlog helps teams focus on valuable work and makes sprint planning smooth. A neglected backlog leads to confusion and wasted effort.

This lesson teaches you how to create and maintain a healthy product backlog that drives effective delivery.

## What is a Product Backlog?

A product backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes.

The backlog is:
- **Living** - It changes constantly as we learn more
- **Ordered** - Most important items are at the top
- **Visible** - Everyone can see what is planned
- **One per product** - Not multiple lists in different places

## Backlog Items

A backlog contains different types of items:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **User Stories** | Features from user perspective | "As a user, I want to search products" |
| **Bugs** | Defects that need fixing | "Login fails on mobile Safari" |
| **Technical Debt** | Improvements to code quality | "Refactor payment module" |
| **Spikes** | Research to reduce uncertainty | "Investigate caching options" |
| **Enablers** | Infrastructure or architecture work | "Set up CI/CD pipeline" |

All these compete for priority in the same backlog.

## Prioritization

Prioritization decides what gets built first. The Product Owner makes final decisions, but uses input from stakeholders, customers, and the team.

### Prioritization Factors

Consider multiple factors when ordering the backlog:

title: Prioritization Factors
items:
  - text: Business value - How much does this help the business?
    icon: "\U0001F4B0"
  - text: User impact - How many users benefit?
    icon: "\U0001F465"
  - text: Risk - Does delaying this create problems?

  - text: Dependencies - Does other work depend on this?
    icon: "\U0001F517"
  - text: Effort - How much work is this relative to value?
    icon: "\U000023F1"
note: High value, high risk items usually go first

### MoSCoW Method

MoSCoW is a simple way to categorize items:

| Category | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Must have** | Essential for release | Build first |
| **Should have** | Important but not critical | Build if time allows |
| **Could have** | Nice to have | Build after shoulds |
| **Will not have** | Out of scope for now | Remove or park |

### Value vs. Effort Matrix

Another approach plots items on a 2x2 matrix:

| | Low Effort | High Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **High Value** | Quick wins - Do first | Major projects - Plan carefully |
| **Low Value** | Fill-ins - Do when convenient | Time sinks - Avoid or simplify |

## Backlog Refinement

Backlog refinement (also called grooming) is the ongoing process of keeping the backlog healthy. Teams typically spend 5-10% of their capacity on refinement.

### What Happens in Refinement

- **Clarify** - Discuss stories to improve understanding
- **Split** - Break large items into smaller pieces
- **Estimate** - Add or update effort estimates
- **Order** - Adjust priorities based on new information
- **Remove** - Delete items that are no longer relevant

### When to Refine

Refinement happens continuously, not just in one meeting. Options include:

- **Dedicated sessions** - Weekly 1-hour refinement meetings
- **Before sprint planning** - Review top items a day before
- **During the sprint** - As questions arise
- **After demos** - When stakeholders provide feedback

### The Refinement Funnel

Items move through stages of readiness:

steps:

    sublabel: Vague concepts, no details
    icon: "\U00002601"

  - label: Discussed
    sublabel: Team understands the need

  - label: Ready
    sublabel: Can be pulled into sprint

Only "ready" items should be pulled into sprint planning.

## Definition of Ready

Just as teams have a Definition of Done, they should have a Definition of Ready. This checklist ensures stories are prepared for sprint planning.

title: Definition of Ready
items:
  - text: User story follows standard format
    icon: "\U0001F4DD"
  - text: Acceptance criteria are defined
    icon: "\U00002705"
  - text: Story is small enough for one sprint
    icon: "\U0001F4CF"
  - text: Dependencies are identified
    icon: "\U0001F517"
  - text: Team has asked questions
    icon: "\U00002753"
  - text: Story is estimated
    icon: "\U0001F522"
note: Do not pull stories into a sprint unless they meet all criteria

## Organizing the Backlog

Large backlogs need organization to remain useful.

### Epics

Group related stories under epics. Epics are themes or large features that span multiple sprints.

Example epic: "User Authentication"
- Stories: Registration, Login, Password reset, Social login, Two-factor auth

### Labels and Tags

Add metadata to filter and find items:
- Component: frontend, backend, database
- Type: feature, bug, tech-debt
- Team: platform, mobile, core

### Swimlanes

Visual boards can use swimlanes to separate work:
- By team
- By product area
- By priority level

## Signs of an Unhealthy Backlog

Watch for these warning signs:

| Problem | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Too long** | Hundreds of items, many stale | Archive old items |
| **Unclear items** | Stories lack details | Invest in refinement |
| **No priorities** | Everything is "high priority" | Force ranking |
| **Duplicate items** | Same request in multiple places | Consolidate |
| **Missing estimates** | Cannot plan sprints | Run estimation sessions |
| **No recent updates** | Backlog unchanged for weeks | Regular refinement |

## Backlog Management in DevOps

DevOps teams manage multiple types of work in their backlogs:

### Balancing Feature and Operational Work

| Work Type | Source | Backlog Approach |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Features | Product requests | Regular prioritization |
| Bugs | Production issues | Fast-track critical bugs |
| Tech debt | Team identifies | Reserve capacity |
| Infrastructure | Platform needs | Treat as features |
| Security | Compliance, scans | Prioritize by risk |

### Handling Production Issues

Production issues need special handling:
1. **Critical** - Skip backlog, fix immediately
2. **High** - Add to current sprint
3. **Medium** - Top of next sprint
4. **Low** - Normal backlog prioritization

## Best Practices

1. **Keep the backlog short** - If items will never be built, remove them
2. **Top items always ready** - Have 2-3 sprints worth of refined stories
3. **Regular refinement** - Do not let the backlog get stale
4. **Single backlog** - Avoid shadow lists in spreadsheets or documents
5. **Transparent priorities** - Everyone should understand why items are ordered
6. **Say no** - Not everything belongs in the backlog

## Common Mistakes

1. **Never removing items** - Backlogs grow forever without pruning
2. **Skipping refinement** - Leads to chaotic sprint planning
3. **Everything is urgent** - When everything is priority 1, nothing is
4. **Too much detail too early** - Only refine items close to being built
5. **Product Owner works alone** - Refinement needs the whole team

## Key Takeaways

- The product backlog is the single source of requirements
- The Product Owner owns the backlog and decides priorities
- Refinement is ongoing, not a single meeting
- Use the Definition of Ready to ensure stories are prepared
- Organize large backlogs with epics, labels, and swimlanes
- Balance feature work with bugs, tech debt, and operational needs
- Keep the backlog short, ordered, and visible

In the next lesson, you will learn about Velocity and Estimation, including how teams measure their capacity and estimate work effort.
