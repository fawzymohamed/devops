        - "Measuring the team's code quality"
      correctAnswer: "Calculating available team hours considering holidays and meetings"
      explanation: "Capacity planning accounts for actual available time. Teams consider holidays, meetings, support duties, and other commitments to determine realistic availability for sprint work."

# Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is the meeting where teams decide what to build in the upcoming sprint. It sets the direction for the next 1-4 weeks of work. Good sprint planning leads to focused teams that deliver valuable software consistently.

This lesson covers how to run effective sprint planning sessions that result in realistic commitments and clear goals.

## What is Sprint Planning?

Sprint planning is a collaborative meeting at the start of each sprint. The entire Scrum team participates: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers.

The meeting answers two key questions:
1. **What** will we deliver this sprint?
2. **How** will we do the work?

## Inputs to Sprint Planning

Before the meeting starts, several things should be ready:

### Product Backlog

The Product Owner brings a prioritized list of user stories. Items at the top should be:
- Refined and well-understood
- Small enough to complete in one sprint
- Have clear acceptance criteria

### Team Capacity

The team needs to know how many hours they actually have available. This is not just working days multiplied by hours.

### Definition of Done

Everyone should know what "done" means. This ensures the team accounts for all work including testing, documentation, and deployment.

### Past Velocity

Historical data helps teams make realistic commitments. Velocity is how much work the team typically completes per sprint.

## The Sprint Goal

The sprint goal is a single objective that the sprint achieves. It gives the team purpose and helps them make decisions during the sprint.

A good sprint goal:
- Describes the value delivered, not the work done
- Is achievable within the sprint
- Helps the team focus
- Allows flexibility in how it is achieved

### Examples

**Vague goal:** "Complete user stories 1-5"
**Better goal:** "Enable customers to complete purchases without calling support"

**Vague goal:** "Improve performance"
**Better goal:** "Reduce checkout page load time to under 2 seconds"

The goal guides decisions. If the team faces a choice during the sprint, they ask: "Which option better serves the sprint goal?"

## Selecting Stories

The team selects stories from the top of the Product Backlog. The Product Owner explains priorities and answers questions. The Developers decide how much they can commit to.

### The Selection Process

1. Product Owner presents the highest priority story
2. Team asks clarifying questions
3. Team discusses if they can complete it
4. If yes, story moves to sprint backlog
5. Repeat until capacity is full

### When to Stop

Teams often try to fit too much into a sprint. Stop adding stories when:
- Capacity is reached
- Uncertainty is too high
- Dependencies create risk

It is better to under-commit and finish early than over-commit and fail.

## Capacity Planning

Capacity planning calculates how much time the team actually has for sprint work.

### Calculate Available Hours

Start with working days in the sprint:
```
Sprint days: 10
Team members: 5
Hours per day: 8
Total hours: 10 x 5 x 8 = 400 hours
```

Then subtract unavailable time:
```
Holidays: -16 hours (2 people out 1 day each)
Meetings: -50 hours (1 hour daily for all)
Support duty: -20 hours (1 person 50% time)
Training: -8 hours (1 person 1 day)
Available: 400 - 94 = 306 hours
```

### Apply Focus Factor

Not all available time is productive work time. Teams typically have a focus factor of 60-80%.

```
Available: 306 hours
Focus factor: 70%
Effective capacity: 306 x 0.70 = 214 hours
```

This effective capacity is what the team uses when planning how much work to take on.

## Breaking Stories into Tasks

After selecting stories, the team breaks them into tasks. This happens in the "how" part of sprint planning.

### Why Break Down Stories?

- Reveals hidden work
- Identifies dependencies
- Helps with daily progress tracking
- Makes estimation more accurate
- Allows work to be distributed

### Task Examples

**User story:** "As a user, I want to reset my password"

**Tasks:**
- Create database migration for reset tokens
- Build reset request API endpoint
- Design password reset email template
- Implement email sending service
- Create reset form page
- Add form validation
- Write unit tests
- Write integration tests
- Update user documentation

Each task should be small enough to complete in one day or less.

## Sprint Planning in DevOps

DevOps teams include operational work in their sprint planning. This work competes with feature development for capacity.

### Types of DevOps Work

| Type | Example | How to Handle |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Features | New user dashboard | Regular user stories |
| Tech debt | Refactor database queries | Allocate percentage of capacity |
| Bugs | Fix login timeout | Reserve buffer or add to sprint |
| Operations | Server maintenance | Include in capacity calculation |
| Incidents | Unplanned outages | Keep buffer for unexpected work |

### Planning for the Unexpected

DevOps teams should not plan to 100% capacity. Keep a buffer for:
- Production incidents
- Urgent bug fixes
- Support requests
- Unexpected dependencies

A common approach is planning to 80% capacity, leaving 20% for unplanned work.

## Meeting Structure

Sprint planning has a timebox based on sprint length:
- 2-week sprint: 4 hours maximum
- 1-week sprint: 2 hours maximum

### Typical Agenda

**Part 1: What (first half)**
1. Review sprint goal options
2. Discuss top backlog items
3. Select stories for the sprint
4. Confirm sprint goal

**Part 2: How (second half)**
1. Break stories into tasks
2. Identify dependencies
3. Assign initial owners (optional)
4. Confirm commitment

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-committing** - Taking on more than the team can deliver
2. **Skipping the goal** - Without a goal, the team lacks focus
3. **Unrefined stories** - Discussing unclear stories wastes planning time
4. **Ignoring capacity** - Not accounting for holidays, meetings, and other work
5. **Planning alone** - Sprint planning requires the whole team
6. **No task breakdown** - Skipping this leads to surprises during the sprint

- Breaking stories into tasks reveals hidden work and improves accuracy
- DevOps teams must plan for operational work and unexpected incidents
- Good planning prevents over-commitment and sets the sprint up for success

In the next lesson, you will learn about Backlog Management, including how to maintain a healthy product backlog that supports effective sprint planning.
