  questions:
    - question: "What is the main purpose of a retrospective?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To review the features built during the sprint"
        - "To identify ways the team can improve their process"
        - "To plan the next sprint's work"
        - "To report progress to stakeholders"
      correctAnswer: "To identify ways the team can improve their process"
      explanation: "Retrospectives focus on HOW the team worked, not WHAT they built. The Sprint Review covers completed work. Retrospectives are about improving the team's process, collaboration, and practices."

    - question: "Select all elements of a healthy retrospective."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Everyone feels safe to speak honestly"
        - "The team identifies specific action items"
        - "Only negative topics are discussed"
        - "Discussion focuses on process, not blame"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Everyone feels safe to speak honestly"
        - "The team identifies specific action items"
        - "Discussion focuses on process, not blame"
      explanation: "Healthy retrospectives need psychological safety, actionable outcomes, and blame-free discussion. Discussing only negatives would miss opportunities to reinforce what works well."

    - question: "Retrospectives should only happen when something goes wrong."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Retrospectives happen every sprint, regardless of how the sprint went. Even successful sprints have lessons. Regular retrospectives build habits of continuous improvement."

    - question: "In the 'Start, Stop, Continue' format, what goes in the 'Stop' category?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Things the team should begin doing"
        - "Things that are working well and should continue"
        - "Things that are not working and should be abandoned"
        - "Things that happened in the past"
      correctAnswer: "Things that are not working and should be abandoned"
      explanation: "Stop items are practices or behaviors that hurt the team and should be abandoned. Start is for new ideas, and Continue is for things working well."

    - question: "What should happen to action items identified in a retrospective?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "They are stored in a document for future reference"
        - "They are assigned to the Scrum Master to complete"
        - "They become tasks in the next sprint"
        - "They are shared with management for approval"
      correctAnswer: "They become tasks in the next sprint"
      explanation: "Action items must be acted upon. Adding them to the next sprint ensures they get done. Storing them in documents usually means they are forgotten."

# Retrospectives

A retrospective is a meeting where teams reflect on how they work and find ways to improve. It is one of the most powerful practices in Agile because it creates a rhythm of continuous improvement.

This lesson teaches you how to run effective retrospectives that lead to real change.

## What is a Retrospective?

A retrospective (often called "retro") is a regular meeting where the team discusses:
- What went well
- What did not go well
- What to improve

Unlike other meetings that focus on the product, retrospectives focus on the process. The goal is to make the team more effective over time.

## Why Retrospectives Matter

Teams that skip retrospectives often:
- Repeat the same mistakes
- Let small problems grow into big ones
- Miss opportunities to improve
- Lose trust and morale over time

Teams that do retrospectives well:
- Continuously improve their processes
- Build trust through open communication
- Feel ownership over how they work
- Adapt quickly to new challenges

## The Prime Directive

Before every retrospective, the facilitator often reads the Prime Directive:

> "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."

This sets the tone: retrospectives are about improving systems, not blaming people.

## Common Formats

Different formats keep retrospectives fresh and draw out different insights.

### Start, Stop, Continue

The simplest format with three categories:

| Category | Question | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Start** | What should we begin doing? | "Start pairing on complex tasks" |
| **Stop** | What should we stop doing? | "Stop scheduling meetings during focus time" |
| **Continue** | What works well? | "Continue daily standups" |

### What Went Well / What Did Not

### Mad, Sad, Glad

Focuses on emotions to surface deeper issues:

- **Mad** - What frustrated you?
- **Sad** - What disappointed you?
- **Glad** - What made you happy?

### 4 Ls

Four categories for comprehensive reflection:

- **Liked** - What did you enjoy?
- **Learned** - What did you learn?
- **Lacked** - What was missing?
- **Longed for** - What did you wish for?

### Sailboat

A visual metaphor:
- **Wind** - What pushed us forward?
- **Anchor** - What held us back?
- **Rocks** - What risks do we see ahead?
- **Island** - What is our goal?

## Running a Retrospective

A typical retrospective follows this structure:

### 1. Set the Stage (5 minutes)

- Welcome everyone
- Review the purpose
- Read the Prime Directive
- Explain today's format

### 2. Gather Data (10-15 minutes)

- Each person writes observations on sticky notes (or virtual equivalent)
- One idea per note
- Everyone works silently first
- Post notes in appropriate categories

### 3. Generate Insights (15-20 minutes)

- Group similar notes together
- Discuss themes and patterns
- Vote on most important topics
- Explore root causes

### 4. Decide What to Do (10-15 minutes)

- Brainstorm possible actions
- Select 1-3 improvements to try
- Make actions specific and assignable
- Add to next sprint

### 5. Close (5 minutes)

- Review action items
- Thank participants
- Quick feedback on the retro itself

## Creating Good Action Items

The most common retrospective failure is identifying problems but not acting on them. Good action items are:

### Example Transformations

**Vague:** "Improve code quality"
**Specific:** "Add linting to CI pipeline by end of sprint"

**Vague:** "Better communication"
**Specific:** "Create Slack channel for deployment notifications"

**Vague:** "Reduce bugs"
**Specific:** "Add unit tests for payment module (80% coverage)"

## Signs of Healthy Retrospectives

| Healthy Sign | What It Looks Like |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Psychological safety** | People share honest concerns |
| **Balance** | Both positives and negatives discussed |
| **Action focus** | Improvements happen between retros |
| **Diverse voices** | Everyone participates, not just loud voices |
| **Follow-through** | Previous actions are reviewed |

## Signs of Unhealthy Retrospectives

| Warning Sign | What It Looks Like |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Blame** | Finger-pointing at individuals |
| **Silence** | Only a few people talk |
| **Repetition** | Same issues every sprint |
| **No actions** | Discussion but no commitments |
| **Skipping** | Retros cancelled when "busy" |

## Retrospectives in DevOps

DevOps culture emphasizes continuous improvement, making retrospectives essential.

### Connecting to Blameless Postmortems

DevOps teams hold postmortems after incidents. These share DNA with retrospectives:

### DevOps Topics for Retros

DevOps retrospectives often discuss:
- Deployment smoothness
- Incident response
- On-call experience
- CI/CD pipeline issues
- Security concerns
- Monitoring gaps
- Automation opportunities

### Metrics to Review

Bring data to retrospectives:
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Change failure rate
- Mean time to recovery
- Test coverage trends
- Bug counts by category

## Remote Retrospectives

Distributed teams need adapted practices:

### Tools

- **Miro** - Virtual whiteboard with templates
- **Retrium** - Purpose-built retro tool
- **EasyRetro** - Simple and free
- **FigJam** - Collaborative design tool

### Tips for Remote Retros

1. **Use video** - Facial expressions matter
2. **Smaller groups** - Breakout rooms for discussions
3. **Async prep** - Gather notes before the meeting
4. **Clear facilitation** - Explicit turn-taking
5. **Written summary** - Share actions afterward

## Best Practices

1. **Hold them consistently** - Every sprint, no exceptions
2. **Change formats** - Prevent staleness
3. **Limit actions** - 1-3 improvements per sprint
4. **Track follow-through** - Review last sprint's actions
5. **Protect the time** - Do not cut short for other work
6. **Rotate facilitator** - Share the responsibility
7. **Include everyone** - Not just developers

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping when things go well** - Good sprints have lessons too
2. **Too many actions** - Team cannot do everything
3. **Blaming people** - Focus on systems, not individuals
4. **No follow-up** - Actions forgotten by next retro
5. **Same format always** - Gets stale over time
6. **Manager dominates** - Others feel unsafe

## Key Takeaways

- Retrospectives focus on process improvement, not product
- The Prime Directive creates psychological safety
- Many formats exist: Start/Stop/Continue, Mad/Sad/Glad, 4Ls, Sailboat
- Actions must be specific, owned, small, and tracked
- Healthy retros have balanced discussion and follow-through
- DevOps connects retros to blameless postmortems
- Hold retrospectives every sprint without exception

This completes the Project Management Basics topic. These practices - user stories, sprint planning, backlog management, velocity, and retrospectives - form the foundation for effective Agile delivery in DevOps environments.
