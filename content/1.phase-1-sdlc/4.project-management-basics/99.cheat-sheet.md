## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **User Story** | Short description of a feature from user perspective |
| **Epic** | Large body of work spanning multiple sprints |
| **Sprint** | Fixed time period (1-4 weeks) for completing work |
| **Backlog** | Ordered list of all work items for the product |
| **Velocity** | Story points completed per sprint |
| **Story Points** | Relative measure of work effort and complexity |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Conditions that define when a story is done |
| **Retrospective** | Team meeting to reflect and improve processes |

## User Story Format

**Standard template:**

> As a **[user type]**, I want **[goal]**, so that **[reason]**.

**Example:**
> As a **customer**, I want to **save items to a wishlist**, so that **I can buy them later**.

## INVEST Criteria for User Stories

| Letter | Meaning | Check |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **I** | Independent | Can be developed alone |
| **N** | Negotiable | Details can be discussed |
| **V** | Valuable | Delivers user/business benefit |
| **E** | Estimable | Team can estimate effort |
| **S** | Small | Fits in one sprint |
| **T** | Testable | Can verify completion |

## Work Item Hierarchy

| Level | Scope | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Epic** | Multiple sprints | User Account Management |
| **Story** | One sprint | Password reset |
| **Task** | Hours/day | Create reset form |

## Sprint Planning Quick Reference

### Inputs
- Prioritized product backlog
- Team capacity (available hours)
- Definition of Done
- Past velocity

### Outputs
- Sprint goal
- Sprint backlog (selected stories)
- Tasks for each story

### Capacity Formula
```
Available Hours = (Sprint Days × Team × Hours/Day) - Holidays - Meetings - Other
Effective Capacity = Available Hours × Focus Factor (60-80%)
```

## Sprint Planning Timebox

| Sprint Length | Max Planning Time |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 week | 2 hours |
| 2 weeks | 4 hours |

## Backlog Item Types

| Type | Description | Priority Approach |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **User Stories** | Features | Business value |
| **Bugs** | Defects | Severity |
| **Tech Debt** | Code quality | Reserve % capacity |
| **Spikes** | Research | Uncertainty reduction |
| **Enablers** | Infrastructure | Dependencies |

## MoSCoW Prioritization

| Category | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Must** | Essential | Build first |
| **Should** | Important | Build if time |
| **Could** | Nice to have | Build after shoulds |
| **Won't** | Out of scope | Remove/park |

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [ ] Story follows standard format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Small enough for one sprint
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Team has asked questions
- [ ] Story is estimated

## Story Points (Fibonacci Scale)

| Points | Relative Size |
|--------|---------------|
| **1** | Tiny - few hours |
| **2** | Small - less than a day |
| **3** | Medium - about a day |
| **5** | Large - few days |
| **8** | Very large - most of a week |
| **13** | Huge - needs splitting |
| **21+** | Epic - definitely split |

## Planning Poker Process

1. **Read** - PO presents story
2. **Discuss** - Team asks questions
3. **Vote** - Pick estimate privately
4. **Reveal** - Show cards simultaneously
5. **Discuss** - High/low explain thinking
6. **Re-vote** - Until consensus

## Velocity Calculations

**Sprint Planning:**
> Plan work ≈ Average velocity

**Release Forecasting:**
> Sprints needed = Total points ÷ Velocity

**Capacity Check:**
> Available points = Sprints remaining × Velocity

## Retrospective Formats

| Format | Categories |
|--------|------------|
| **Start/Stop/Continue** | Begin, abandon, keep doing |
| **What Went Well/Didn't** | Successes, struggles |
| **Mad/Sad/Glad** | Frustrations, disappointments, joys |
| **4 Ls** | Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for |
| **Sailboat** | Wind, anchor, rocks, island |

## Retrospective Structure

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Set Stage** | 5 min | Welcome, Prime Directive |
| **Gather Data** | 10-15 min | Silent writing, posting |
| **Generate Insights** | 15-20 min | Group, discuss, vote |
| **Decide Actions** | 10-15 min | Select 1-3 improvements |
| **Close** | 5 min | Review, thanks |

## Good Action Items Are...

| Quality | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Specific** | "Add linting to CI pipeline" |
| **Owned** | Assigned to someone |
| **Small** | Completable in one sprint |
| **Tracked** | Added to sprint backlog |

## The Prime Directive

> "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."

## Common Pitfalls

| Area | Pitfall | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Stories** | Too technical | Focus on user needs |
| **Stories** | Missing "so that" | Always include the why |
| **Planning** | Over-committing | Leave 20% buffer |
| **Planning** | No task breakdown | Break down all stories |
| **Backlog** | Too many items | Regularly prune |
| **Backlog** | Everything urgent | Force rank priorities |
| **Estimation** | Using hours | Use story points |
| **Estimation** | Individual-based | Estimate the work, not who |
| **Retros** | No actions | Always commit to 1-3 items |
| **Retros** | Blame culture | Use Prime Directive |

## DevOps Work Planning

| Work Type | Sprint Approach |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Features | Regular stories |
| Bugs | Fast-track critical |
| Tech debt | Reserve 10-20% |
| On-call | Buffer capacity |
| Incidents | Keep 20% unplanned |

## Interview Quick Hits

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is a user story? | A short description of a feature from the user's perspective: "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [reason]" |
| What does INVEST stand for? | Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable - criteria for good user stories |
| What is velocity in Agile? | The average number of story points a team completes per sprint, used for planning |
| What's the purpose of a retrospective? | To reflect on what went well, what didn't, and identify 1-3 actionable improvements |
| Why use story points instead of hours? | Story points measure relative complexity, not time, and avoid individual-based estimates |
| What is MoSCoW prioritization? | Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have - a method for prioritizing requirements |
