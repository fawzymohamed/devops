    - question: "What is the standard format for writing a user story?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Given-When-Then"
        - "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [reason]"
        - "Title, Description, Priority"
        - "Who, What, When, Where, Why"
      correctAnswer: "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [reason]"
      explanation: "The standard user story format is 'As a [user type], I want [some goal], so that [some reason].' This format ensures every story focuses on who needs it, what they need, and why it matters."

    - question: "Select all characteristics of a good user story according to INVEST."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Independent - can be developed separately"
        - "Negotiable - details can be discussed"
        - "Valuable - delivers benefit to users"
        - "Exact - specifies all implementation details"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Independent - can be developed separately"
        - "Negotiable - details can be discussed"
        - "Valuable - delivers benefit to users"
      explanation: "INVEST stands for Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable. Stories should NOT be exact or specify implementation details - they describe what users need, not how to build it."

    - question: "User stories should include detailed technical specifications."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. User stories focus on user needs and business value, not technical details. The development team decides how to implement the story. Stories describe the 'what' and 'why,' not the 'how.'"

    - question: "What is an epic in Agile terminology?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "A very urgent user story"
        - "A large user story that needs to be broken into smaller stories"
        - "A bug that must be fixed immediately"
        - "A completed user story"
      correctAnswer: "A large user story that needs to be broken into smaller stories"
      explanation: "An epic is a large body of work that cannot be completed in one sprint. Teams break epics into smaller user stories that can be finished within a sprint. Epics help organize related features."

# User Stories

User stories are the building blocks of Agile development. They capture what users need in simple, non-technical language. Instead of long requirements documents, teams use short statements that keep everyone focused on delivering value to real people.

This lesson teaches you how to write effective user stories that development teams can understand, estimate, and deliver.

## What is a User Story?

A user story is a short description of something a user wants to do. It describes a feature from the perspective of the person who will use it.

Unlike traditional requirements that focus on system behavior, user stories focus on user goals. They answer three questions:
- **Who** needs this feature?
- **What** do they want to do?
- **Why** do they want it?

## The User Story Format

The most common format for user stories is:

**As a [type of user], I want [some goal], so that [some reason].**

This simple template ensures every story includes the essential information.

### Examples

**E-commerce application:**
> As a **customer**, I want to **save items to a wishlist**, so that **I can buy them later**.

**Internal tool:**
> As a **sales manager**, I want to **export reports to PDF**, so that **I can share them in meetings**.

**DevOps context:**
> As a **developer**, I want to **see build status in my pull request**, so that **I know if my code is ready to merge**.

## Components of a User Story

A complete user story includes more than just the description. Teams typically add:

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria define when the story is done. They are specific conditions that must be true for the story to be accepted.

Example story:
> As a user, I want to reset my password, so that I can access my account if I forget it.

Acceptance criteria:
- User can request password reset from login page
- System sends email with reset link within 5 minutes
- Reset link expires after 24 hours
- User must create a password with at least 8 characters
- User sees confirmation message after successful reset

### Priority

How important is this story compared to others? Product Owners set priorities based on business value.

### Estimate

How much effort will this story take? Teams estimate using story points or relative sizing.

## The INVEST Criteria

Good user stories follow the INVEST criteria. Use this checklist to evaluate your stories:

| Letter | Meaning | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **I** | Independent | Can be developed without depending on other stories |
| **N** | Negotiable | Details can be discussed and changed |
| **V** | Valuable | Delivers clear benefit to users or business |
| **E** | Estimable | Team can estimate the effort required |
| **S** | Small | Can be completed within one sprint |
| **T** | Testable | You can verify when it is done |

### Applying INVEST

**Bad story:** "Improve the user experience"
- Not independent (too vague to separate)
- Not estimable (how much work is this?)
- Not testable (how do you know when it is improved?)

**Good story:** "As a user, I want to see my order history sorted by date, so that I can find recent orders quickly."
- Independent (can build this feature alone)
- Negotiable (can discuss sort order, number of items)
- Valuable (helps users find orders)
- Estimable (team can estimate this)
- Small (fits in a sprint)
- Testable (can verify sorting works)

## Stories, Tasks, and Epics

User stories exist within a hierarchy. Understanding this hierarchy helps teams organize work.

### Epic

An epic is a large body of work that takes multiple sprints to complete. Epics are too big to estimate accurately, so teams break them into smaller stories.

Example epic: "User Account Management"

### User Story

A user story is a piece of an epic that can be completed in one sprint. It delivers a specific piece of value.

Example stories from the epic:
- User registration
- Password reset
- Profile editing
- Account deletion

### Task

A task is a technical step needed to complete a story. Tasks are what developers work on day to day.

Example tasks for "Password reset" story:
- Create password reset endpoint
- Design email template
- Add reset form to login page
- Write unit tests

## Writing Tips

### Focus on the User

Always write from the user's perspective. Avoid technical language.

**Bad:** "The system shall implement OAuth 2.0 authentication"
**Good:** "As a user, I want to log in with my Google account, so that I do not need another password"

### Keep It Simple

Stories should be short enough to fit on an index card. If you need more space, the story is probably too big.

### Include the Why

The "so that" part is often skipped but is crucial. It explains the value and helps the team make good decisions during development.

**Without why:** "As a user, I want to filter products by color"
**With why:** "As a user, I want to filter products by color, so that I can find items that match my preferences"

## User Stories in DevOps

In DevOps environments, user stories are not just for features. Teams write stories for:

- **Infrastructure improvements:** "As a developer, I want deployments to complete in under 5 minutes"
- **Monitoring:** "As an operator, I want alerts when CPU exceeds 80%"
- **Automation:** "As a tester, I want tests to run automatically on each commit"
- **Security:** "As a compliance officer, I want audit logs for all data access"

## Common Mistakes

1. **Writing technical specifications** - Stories describe user needs, not implementation
2. **Making stories too big** - If it takes more than a sprint, break it down
3. **Skipping acceptance criteria** - Without them, "done" is unclear
4. **Forgetting the "so that"** - The reason explains the value
5. **Using vague language** - "Improve performance" is not testable

## Key Takeaways

- User stories capture requirements in simple, user-focused language
- The format is: As a [user], I want [goal], so that [reason]
- Acceptance criteria define when a story is complete
- Good stories follow the INVEST criteria
- Epics break into stories, which break into tasks
- Stories help teams deliver value incrementally

In the next lesson, you will learn about Sprint Planning, where teams select user stories and plan their work for the upcoming sprint.
