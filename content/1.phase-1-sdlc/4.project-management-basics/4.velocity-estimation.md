    - question: "What do story points measure?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "The number of hours needed to complete a story"
        - "The relative size and complexity of work"
        - "How many developers are needed"
        - "The business value of a feature"
      correctAnswer: "The relative size and complexity of work"
      explanation: "Story points measure relative effort, not time. A 2-point story is roughly twice as much work as a 1-point story. This accounts for complexity, uncertainty, and effort without converting to hours."

    - question: "Select all factors that should influence story point estimates."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Complexity of the work"
        - "Amount of work involved"
        - "Risk and uncertainty"
        - "Who will do the work"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Complexity of the work"
        - "Amount of work involved"
        - "Risk and uncertainty"
      explanation: "Story points consider complexity, effort, and risk. They should NOT consider who does the work - estimates represent the work itself, not individual developer speed."

    - question: "A team's velocity should remain exactly the same every sprint."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Velocity naturally varies due to holidays, team changes, different types of work, and other factors. Teams use average velocity over several sprints to plan, accepting that individual sprints will vary."

        - "A game developers play during breaks"
        - "A technique for estimating stories as a team"
        - "A method for assigning tasks to developers"
        - "A way to track time spent on work"
      correctAnswer: "A technique for estimating stories as a team"
      explanation: "Planning Poker is an estimation technique where each team member secretly selects an estimate, then all reveal simultaneously. This prevents anchoring and encourages discussion when estimates differ."

    - question: "Why should teams avoid using hours instead of story points?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Hours are too accurate for Agile"
        - "Hours lead to comparing developer performance"
        - "Hours are harder to calculate"
        - "Story points were invented first"
      correctAnswer: "Hours lead to comparing developer performance"
      explanation: "Hour estimates invite comparisons between team members. If Alice estimates 4 hours and Bob says 8, it implies one is faster. Story points avoid this by measuring work, not people. They also handle uncertainty better."

# Velocity & Estimation

Estimation helps teams plan what they can deliver. Velocity measures what they actually deliver. Together, these practices create predictability and help teams make realistic commitments.

This lesson covers how to estimate work effectively and use velocity to improve sprint planning and forecasting.

## Why Estimate?

Teams estimate for several reasons:
- **Planning sprints** - Know how much work fits in a sprint
- **Setting expectations** - Give stakeholders realistic timelines
- **Making tradeoffs** - Compare effort versus value
- **Improving** - Track if estimates get more accurate over time

Estimates are not commitments. They are educated guesses that help with planning.

## Story Points

Story points are the most common estimation unit in Agile teams. They measure the **relative size** of work, not the time it takes.

### What Story Points Include

Story points combine several factors:

### Why Not Hours?

Hour estimates have problems:
- People work at different speeds
- Comparing hours compares people
- Interruptions make hours unpredictable
- Pressure to meet hour estimates causes bad behavior

Story points avoid these issues by measuring work, not people.

### The Fibonacci Scale

Most teams use a Fibonacci-like sequence for story points:

**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21**

The gaps grow larger at higher numbers. This reflects reality - we cannot tell the difference between a 15-point and 16-point story, but we can distinguish 3 from 5.

| Points | Relative Size |
|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Tiny - A few hours of work |
| 2 | Small - Less than a day |
| 3 | Medium - About a day |
| 5 | Large - A few days |
| 8 | Very large - Most of a week |
| 13 | Huge - Needs breaking down |
| 21+ | Epic - Definitely split this |

## Planning Poker

Planning Poker is a team estimation technique that prevents bias and encourages discussion.

1. **Read** - Product Owner reads the user story
2. **Discuss** - Team asks clarifying questions
3. **Vote** - Each person secretly picks an estimate
4. **Reveal** - Everyone shows their card at the same time
5. **Discuss** - If estimates differ, high and low explain their thinking
6. **Re-vote** - Repeat until consensus or close enough

### Why Simultaneous Reveal?

Showing cards at the same time prevents **anchoring**. If a senior developer says "5 points" first, others might adjust their estimate to match. Simultaneous reveal ensures independent thinking.

### Reference Stories

Teams often keep a reference story for calibration:

> "Remember the payment integration? That was an 8. Is this story bigger or smaller?"

Reference stories help new team members and keep estimates consistent over time.

## Velocity

Velocity is the amount of work a team completes per sprint, measured in story points.

### Calculating Velocity

At the end of each sprint, add up the points of completed stories. Only count stories that are **Done** according to the Definition of Done.

```
Sprint 1: 23 points
Sprint 2: 28 points
Sprint 3: 21 points
Sprint 4: 25 points
Average velocity: 24 points/sprint
```

### Using Velocity for Planning

Velocity helps answer planning questions:

**How much can we do next sprint?**
Use average velocity. If average is 24 points, plan for about 24 points of work.

**When will this feature be done?**
Divide total story points by velocity.
- Feature backlog: 72 points
- Velocity: 24 points/sprint
- Estimate: 3 sprints

**Can we meet this deadline?**
Calculate sprints remaining, multiply by velocity.
- Sprints until deadline: 4
- Velocity: 24 points
- Capacity: 96 points
- Required work: 110 points
- Answer: Probably not without reducing scope

### Velocity Trends

Track velocity over time to spot patterns:

| Trend | Possible Cause | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Increasing | Team improving, better estimation | Continue current practices |
| Decreasing | Technical debt, team changes | Investigate and address |
| Stable | Mature team, consistent work | Use for reliable forecasting |
| Erratic | Changing team, varied work types | Increase sample size |

## Common Estimation Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Estimating as Individuals

**Problem:** "Alice can do this in 2 days, so it's a 2"

**Solution:** Estimate the work, not who does it. Anyone on the team should be able to pick up the story.

### Pitfall 2: Gaming Velocity

**Problem:** Team inflates estimates to look faster

**Solution:** Velocity is for planning, not performance reviews. High velocity from inflated estimates does not help planning.

### Pitfall 3: Over-Precision

**Problem:** "This is exactly 7.5 points"

**Solution:** Use the Fibonacci scale. The false precision of 7.5 versus 8 does not exist in reality.

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Uncertainty

**Problem:** "Best case, this is a 3"

**Solution:** Include uncertainty in estimates. If it might be 3 or might be 8, estimate 8.

### Pitfall 5: Punishing Missed Estimates

**Problem:** Team gets blamed when estimates are wrong

**Solution:** Estimates are guesses. Use variance to improve the process, not to blame people.

## Estimation in DevOps

DevOps work often involves uncertainty that makes estimation challenging.

### Estimating Infrastructure Work

| Work Type | Estimation Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| New service | Compare to similar past services |
| Bug fixes | Size based on investigation time |
| Performance | Add buffer for unknowns |
| Security | Include remediation and testing |

### Handling Operational Interruptions

Operational work disrupts planned velocity:

```
Planned capacity: 30 points
On-call duty: -5 points buffer
Expected velocity: 25 points
```

Build this buffer into sprint planning. Track actual operational interruptions to calibrate the buffer.

### Spikes for Unknowns

When uncertainty is too high to estimate, use a spike:

1. Create a timeboxed research task (e.g., "4 hours to investigate caching options")
2. After the spike, estimate the actual implementation
3. Add the implementation to the backlog

## Alternative Approaches

Some teams use different estimation methods:

### T-Shirt Sizing

Use S, M, L, XL instead of numbers. Simpler but less precise for planning.

### No Estimates

Some teams skip estimation entirely, focusing on breaking work into similarly-sized pieces. Requires highly disciplined story splitting.

### Flow Metrics

Instead of predicting, measure cycle time (how long stories take) and throughput (how many finish per week). Uses historical data rather than predictions.

## Key Takeaways

- Story points measure relative size, not time
- Use Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Planning Poker prevents bias and encourages discussion
- Velocity is completed points per sprint
- Use average velocity for planning, not individual sprints
- Estimate the work, not who does it
- Accept that estimates are guesses, not commitments

In the next lesson, you will learn about Retrospectives, where teams reflect on their process and identify improvements.
