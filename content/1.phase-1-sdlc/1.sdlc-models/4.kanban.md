    - question: "What is the primary purpose of Work in Progress (WIP) limits in Kanban?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To prevent team members from multitasking and improve focus and flow"
        - "To ensure all team members have equal amounts of work"
        - "To limit the total number of tasks in the backlog"
        - "To restrict how many hours team members can work per day"
      correctAnswer: "To prevent team members from multitasking and improve focus and flow"
      explanation: "WIP limits constrain the number of work items allowed in each stage of the workflow. This prevents multitasking, reduces context switching, exposes bottlenecks, and helps work flow smoothly through the system. When a column reaches its WIP limit, the team must complete existing work before pulling new items."

        - "Visualize the workflow"
        - "Limit Work in Progress"
        - "Manage and improve flow"
        - "Make process policies explicit"
      explanation: "Kanban's core principles include visualizing work, limiting WIP, managing flow, making policies explicit, implementing feedback loops, and improving collaboratively. Unlike Scrum, Kanban does not require fixed-length sprints - it emphasizes continuous flow instead of timeboxed iterations."
    - question: "In Kanban, work items are assigned to team members by the project manager at the start of each week."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Kanban uses a pull system where team members pull work items when they have capacity, rather than having work pushed to them. This self-directed approach respects individual capacity and prevents overload. There is no requirement for weekly planning or manager assignment."
    - question: "What happens when a bottleneck is identified in a Kanban workflow?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "The team swarms to help clear the bottleneck or adjusts the process"
        - "The team waits until the next sprint to address it"
        - "Work items are automatically moved to other columns"
        - "The WIP limit for that column is increased to allow more work"
      correctAnswer: "The team swarms to help clear the bottleneck or adjusts the process"
      explanation: "When bottlenecks occur (work piling up in one column), Kanban teams respond by swarming - having team members help clear the blocked stage. This might mean pausing new work or adjusting the process. Increasing WIP limits would defeat the purpose of exposing and addressing bottlenecks."
    - question: "How does Kanban differ from Scrum in handling new work requests?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Kanban allows adding work continuously while Scrum protects the Sprint backlog"
        - "Both require waiting until the end of the current iteration"
        - "Scrum allows adding work anytime while Kanban protects the board"
        - "Neither methodology allows adding new work during active development"
      correctAnswer: "Kanban allows adding work continuously while Scrum protects the Sprint backlog"
      explanation: "Kanban's continuous flow model allows new work to be added to the backlog at any time and pulled when capacity exists. In Scrum, the Sprint backlog is protected once Sprint Planning is complete, and new work typically waits until the next Sprint. This makes Kanban more suitable for unpredictable work like support and operations."

# Kanban Method

Kanban offers a different approach to Agile than the sprint-based frameworks we have explored. Instead of organizing work into fixed iterations, Kanban emphasizes continuous flow, visualization, and limiting work in progress. For DevOps professionals, Kanban is particularly valuable because it maps naturally to operational workflows where work arrives continuously and unpredictably, such as incident response, support tickets, and infrastructure maintenance.

## What is Kanban?

Kanban is a **visual workflow management method** that helps teams manage work by visualizing tasks, limiting work in progress, and optimizing the flow of work through a system. The word "Kanban" is Japanese for "visual signal" or "card," reflecting its origins in manufacturing.

Unlike Scrum with its defined sprints, Kanban operates as a **continuous flow system**. Work items move through stages from start to finish without the rhythm of iteration boundaries. This makes Kanban ideal for teams whose work arrives continuously rather than in planned batches.

## Origins of Kanban

Kanban originated in **Toyota's manufacturing system** in the late 1940s, developed by industrial engineer Taiichi Ohno. Toyota used Kanban cards to signal when parts needed replenishment on the assembly line, creating a "just-in-time" production system that minimized inventory and waste.

In 2007, **David J. Anderson** adapted these manufacturing principles for knowledge work and software development, publishing the foundational book "Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business" in 2010.

**Key Historical Context:**
- **1940s-1950s**: Toyota develops Kanban for manufacturing
- **2004**: David Anderson applies Kanban to software at Microsoft
- **2007**: First software Kanban systems documented
- **2010**: Anderson publishes the definitive Kanban book
- **Today**: Kanban is widely used in DevOps, IT operations, and support teams

## Core Principles of Kanban

Kanban is built on six core practices that work together to optimize workflow:

### 1. Visualize the Workflow

Make all work visible on a Kanban board. This transparency helps everyone understand what is being worked on, what is blocked, and where work is accumulating.

**Why It Matters:**
- Hidden work creates confusion and misaligned priorities
- Visual boards expose problems that would otherwise go unnoticed
- Team members can see the full context of their work

### 2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)

Set explicit limits on how many items can be in each stage simultaneously. This is the most distinctive and powerful aspect of Kanban.

**Why It Matters:**
- Reduces context switching and improves focus
- Exposes bottlenecks immediately
- Encourages finishing work before starting new work
- Creates a natural pull system

### 3. Manage Flow

Focus on keeping work moving smoothly through the system. Monitor cycle time (how long items take to complete) and look for ways to reduce delays.

**Why It Matters:**
- Faster flow means faster delivery of value
- Smooth flow reduces stress and improves predictability
- Flow problems indicate process issues to address

### 4. Make Process Policies Explicit

Document the rules for how work moves through stages. What does "Done" mean for each column? What criteria must be met to move forward?

**Why It Matters:**
- Removes ambiguity and disagreements
- Enables consistent decision-making
- Makes it easier to discuss and improve the process

### 5. Implement Feedback Loops

Create regular opportunities to inspect the system and gather feedback. This includes daily standups, delivery reviews, and retrospectives.

**Why It Matters:**
- Continuous learning improves the process over time
- Early feedback prevents problems from compounding
- Teams adapt to changing circumstances

### 6. Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally

Use the scientific method to make incremental improvements. Propose changes as experiments, measure results, and keep what works.

**Why It Matters:**
- Small, safe changes are easier to implement
- Data-driven decisions replace guesswork
- Continuous improvement becomes a habit

## The Kanban Board

The Kanban board is the central tool for visualizing work. While implementations vary, most boards share common elements:

### Board Structure

A typical Kanban board has columns representing workflow stages, with cards representing work items that move from left to right.

| Column | Purpose | Example WIP Limit |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Backlog** | All potential work, prioritized | No limit (or high) |
| **Ready** | Items prepared and ready to start | 5 items |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on | 3 items |
| **Review** | Awaiting peer review or approval | 2 items |
| **Done** | Completed and delivered | No limit |

### Work Item Cards

Each card on the board represents a unit of work and typically includes:

- **Title**: Brief description of the work
- **Owner**: Who is working on it
- **Type**: Bug, feature, task, etc.
- **Priority**: Visual indicator (color, tag, or position)
- **Dates**: When it was started, blocked, or completed
- **Blockers**: Any impediments (often marked with a red flag)

### Swimlanes

Horizontal lanes can segment work by type, priority, or team member:

- **Expedite lane**: For urgent items that bypass normal WIP limits
- **Team lanes**: Separate sections for different sub-teams
- **Type lanes**: Bugs, features, and maintenance separated

## Work in Progress (WIP) Limits

WIP limits are the heart of Kanban. They constrain the amount of work allowed in each stage, creating a **pull system** where new work is only started when capacity exists.

### How WIP Limits Work

When a column reaches its WIP limit, no new items can enter that column. The team must either:
- Complete existing work to free up capacity
- Help clear downstream bottlenecks
- Wait until work moves forward

### Setting Effective WIP Limits

| Approach | Guidance |
|----------|----------|
| **Start conservatively** | Begin with low limits and adjust based on experience |
| **Consider team size** | A common starting point is team members minus one |
| **Include buffers** | Account for blocked items and handoffs |
| **Adjust based on data** | Track cycle time and throughput to find optimal limits |

### The Pull System

Unlike push systems where work is assigned to people, Kanban's pull system lets team members **pull work when ready**:

1. Developer completes a task in "In Progress"
2. Card moves to "Review"
3. Developer pulls the next prioritized item from "Ready"
4. If "In Progress" is at WIP limit, developer helps elsewhere

This respects individual capacity and prevents overload.

## Kanban vs Scrum Comparison

Both Kanban and Scrum implement Agile principles, but they differ significantly in structure:

| Aspect | Kanban | Scrum |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Cadence** | Continuous flow | Fixed sprints (1-4 weeks) |
| **Roles** | No prescribed roles | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers |
| **Planning** | Continuous prioritization | Sprint Planning event |
| **Change** | Can add work anytime | Sprint backlog is protected |
| **Metrics** | Cycle time, throughput | Velocity, sprint burndown |
| **Commitments** | Flow-based | Sprint Goal |
| **Meetings** | Optional, as needed | Five prescribed events |
| **Best For** | Continuous work, support, operations | Feature development, projects |

### When to Choose Kanban

**Kanban excels when:**
- Work arrives continuously and unpredictably
- Quick turnaround on individual items is important
- The team handles maintenance, support, or operations
- You want to improve without changing existing processes
- Team members work on multiple project types

**Kanban may struggle when:**
- Stakeholders expect regular delivery milestones
- The team needs structure to stay focused
- Complex features require coordinated effort
- Estimation and velocity tracking are required

## Kanban in DevOps Context

Kanban aligns naturally with DevOps workflows where work flows continuously:

### DevOps Kanban Board Example

A DevOps team might structure their board like this:

### Metrics for DevOps Teams

| Metric | Description | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Lead Time** | Time from request to delivery | Measures responsiveness |
| **Cycle Time** | Time from start to completion | Measures efficiency |
| **Throughput** | Items completed per time period | Measures capacity |
| **WIP Age** | How long items have been in progress | Identifies stuck work |

## Best Practices for Kanban Success

- **Start with what you do now**: Kanban does not require reorganizing your team or process
- **Respect current roles**: Improve incrementally without disrupting what works
- **Make blockers visible**: Use visual indicators (red tags) for blocked items
- **Review the board daily**: Short standups keep work flowing
- **Celebrate completion**: Focus on finishing, not starting
- **Swarm on bottlenecks**: When work piles up, everyone helps clear it

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring WIP limits**: Treating limits as suggestions defeats their purpose; when limits are reached, stop starting and start finishing
2. **Too many columns**: Overly complex boards create confusion; start simple and add columns only when needed
3. **No explicit policies**: Without documented rules, team members make inconsistent decisions about when work is ready to move forward

## Key Takeaways

- Kanban is a visual workflow method emphasizing continuous flow rather than iterations
- WIP limits are the core mechanism that creates a pull system and exposes bottlenecks
- Unlike Scrum, Kanban has no required roles, sprints, or ceremonies
- Kanban is ideal for DevOps teams handling continuous, unpredictable work like operations and support
- The six core practices (visualize, limit WIP, manage flow, explicit policies, feedback loops, improve collaboratively) work together
