  questions:
    - question: "What does the Agile Manifesto value MORE than comprehensive documentation?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Following a plan"
        - "Working software"
        - "Contract negotiation"
        - "Detailed processes"
      correctAnswer: "Working software"
      explanation: "The Agile Manifesto states 'Working software over comprehensive documentation.' This does not mean documentation is bad, but that delivering software that works is more important."

    - question: "What is a sprint in Agile development?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "A meeting where the team plans the entire project"
        - "A short, fixed time period where the team completes specific work"
        - "A type of testing that happens at the end of the project"
        - "A document that lists all project requirements"
      correctAnswer: "A short, fixed time period where the team completes specific work"
      explanation: "A sprint is a time-boxed iteration, usually 1-4 weeks long. During a sprint, the team picks items from the backlog and works to complete them. Each sprint produces potentially shippable work."

    - question: "Select all items that are core values of the Agile Manifesto."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
        - "Detailed planning over responding to change"
        - "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"
        - "Responding to change over following a plan"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
        - "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"
        - "Responding to change over following a plan"
      explanation: "The Agile Manifesto has four values. Three of them are listed here correctly. 'Detailed planning over responding to change' is backwards - Agile values responding to change OVER following a plan."

    - question: "Agile teams deliver working software only at the end of the project."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. Agile teams deliver working software frequently, often every few weeks. This is one of the key differences from Waterfall, where users see the product only at the end."

    - question: "What is a Product Backlog?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "A list of bugs that need fixing"
        - "A prioritized list of features and work items for the product"
        - "A log of all meetings the team has held"
        - "A record of completed sprints"
      correctAnswer: "A prioritized list of features and work items for the product"
      explanation: "The Product Backlog is a living list of everything the product might need. Items at the top are the most important and are picked first for upcoming sprints. The Product Owner maintains this list."

# Agile Methodology

Agile is a way of developing software that welcomes change instead of fighting it. Rather than trying to plan everything upfront, Agile teams work in short cycles, deliver working software frequently, and adjust their plans based on what they learn.

The Agile approach emerged in 2001 when seventeen software developers met to discuss better ways of working. They created the Agile Manifesto, a simple document that changed how millions of teams build software today.

## What is Agile?

Agile is an **iterative and incremental** approach to software development. Instead of building the entire product at once, teams build it piece by piece. Each piece is a working version of the software that users can actually try.

Think of it like writing a book. Waterfall would mean writing every chapter perfectly before anyone reads anything. Agile would mean writing one chapter, letting readers give feedback, and using that feedback to improve the next chapter.

## The Agile Manifesto

In February 2001, the creators of Agile wrote down four core values. These values guide every decision an Agile team makes.

### Understanding the Four Values

**1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**

The best processes and tools cannot fix a broken team. Agile puts people first. Good communication between team members matters more than having the perfect project management software.

**2. Working software over comprehensive documentation**

Documentation has its place, but the main goal is software that works. A running application proves progress better than any document can. Teams write enough documentation to be helpful, but not so much that it slows them down.

**3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**

Instead of hiding behind contracts, Agile teams work closely with customers. They show progress regularly and ask for feedback. This partnership helps ensure the team builds what customers actually need.

**4. Responding to change over following a plan**

Change is not the enemy. In Agile, when new information arrives, teams adapt. A plan is useful as a starting point, but teams should not follow it blindly when circumstances change.

## The Twelve Principles

Behind the four values are twelve principles that explain how Agile works in practice:

## How Iterative Development Works

Agile breaks work into short cycles called **iterations** or **sprints**. Each cycle follows a similar pattern:

steps:
  - label: Plan
    sublabel: Pick work items
    icon: "\U0001F4CB"
    color: violet
  - label: Build

### The Sprint Cycle

1. **Plan:** The team selects the most important items from the Product Backlog. They commit to finishing these items during the sprint.

2. **Build:** Developers write code, designers create interfaces, testers check quality. The team collaborates daily to solve problems.

3. **Review:** At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates what they built to stakeholders. Users can try the working software and give feedback.

4. **Reflect:** The team discusses what went well and what could improve. They make small changes to work better in the next sprint.

## Key Agile Concepts

### User Stories

User stories describe features from the user's perspective. They follow a simple format:

> "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

Example: "As a customer, I want to save items to a wishlist so that I can buy them later."

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of everything the product needs. New ideas go into the backlog. The most important items sit at the top and get built first.

### Daily Standup

Each day, the team meets briefly (usually 15 minutes or less) to answer three questions:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Are there any blockers in my way?

### Definition of Done

The team agrees on what "done" means. A feature is not done until it meets all criteria - code written, tests passing, documentation updated, deployed to a test environment, and reviewed by another developer.

## Common Agile Frameworks

Agile is a mindset, not a strict process. Several frameworks help teams apply Agile principles:

### Scrum

The most popular Agile framework. Scrum defines roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers), events (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment). You will learn more about Scrum in the next lesson.

### Kanban

Kanban focuses on visualizing work and limiting how many items the team works on at once. Teams use a board with columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Work flows through the columns from left to right.

### Extreme Programming (XP)

XP emphasizes technical practices like pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration. It works well for teams that want strong engineering discipline alongside Agile values.

## When to Use Agile

Agile works best when:

- Requirements are likely to change
- Fast feedback from users is valuable
- The team can work closely with stakeholders
- The product needs to evolve over time
- Innovation and experimentation are important

Agile may be harder to apply when:

- Requirements are fixed by regulation
- Contracts require detailed upfront specifications
- Teams and stakeholders cannot communicate frequently
- The project has a strict fixed scope and deadline

## Key Takeaways

- Agile is an iterative approach that delivers working software in short cycles
- The Agile Manifesto defines four values that prioritize people, working software, collaboration, and adaptability
- Twelve principles guide Agile teams in their daily decisions
- Key concepts include user stories, the product backlog, sprints, and daily standups
- Agile differs from Waterfall by embracing change and delivering value continuously
- Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming

In the next lesson, you will dive deeper into Scrum, the most widely used Agile framework, and learn how its roles, events, and artifacts work together.
