# Kanban Method

Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Unlike Scrum with its sprints and ceremonies, Kanban focuses on continuous flow. Work items move across a board from start to finish, and the team improves their process by watching how work flows.

The word "kanban" is Japanese for "visual signal" or "card." In this lesson, you will learn how this simple concept became a powerful method for organizing work in software development and DevOps.

## Origins of Kanban

Kanban was born on the factory floor at Toyota in Japan during the 1940s and 1950s. Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer, noticed a problem: the factory was making too many parts, and inventory was piling up.

Ohno got an idea from an unlikely place - American supermarkets. He saw how stores restocked shelves only when items were taken by customers. The shelf becoming empty was the "signal" to bring more products.

He applied this concept to manufacturing. Workers would use cards (kanban) to signal when they needed more parts. Upstream processes would only produce when downstream processes requested it. This "just-in-time" approach reduced waste dramatically.

In the early 2000s, David Anderson adapted these ideas for software development. He kept the core concepts - visual boards, limiting work in progress, and continuous improvement - while reshaping them for knowledge work.

## Core Principles

Kanban is built on several foundational principles that guide how teams work.

### Visualize the Workflow

You cannot improve what you cannot see. A Kanban board makes all work visible. Everyone can see what is being worked on, what is waiting, and where problems exist.

### Limit Work in Progress

This is the key insight that makes Kanban work. By limiting how many items can be in each stage, you prevent overload and find bottlenecks quickly. More on this below.

### Manage and Improve Flow

Watch how work moves through the system. Look for places where work piles up or slows down. Continuously make small improvements to smooth the flow.

### Make Policies Explicit

Write down the rules. What does "Done" mean? When can an item move to the next column? When policies are clear and visible, the team makes consistent decisions.

### Implement Feedback Loops

Regular meetings and reviews help the team learn and adapt. Kanban does not prescribe specific meetings, but feedback is essential for improvement.

### Improve Collaboratively

The team owns the process. Changes come from the people doing the work, not from management imposing new rules.

## The Kanban Board

The Kanban board is where work becomes visible. It is a board divided into columns that represent stages of your workflow.

### Basic Columns

A simple Kanban board has three columns:

- **To Do** - Work that is ready to start
- **In Progress** - Work currently being done
- **Done** - Completed work

### Advanced Columns

Real workflows are more complex. You might add columns for:

- **Backlog** - Ideas and requests not yet prioritized
- **Analysis** - Requirements being clarified
- **Development** - Code being written
- **Code Review** - Waiting for peer review
- **Testing** - Quality assurance
- **Deployment** - Ready to release
- **Done** - Delivered to users

The key is to model your actual workflow. If work really goes through six stages, show six columns. Do not hide complexity.

### Cards

Each work item is represented by a card. Cards move across the board from left to right as work progresses. A card typically shows:

- Title or description
- Who is working on it
- Priority or type
- Due date (if applicable)
- Any blockers

## WIP Limits

WIP (Work In Progress) limits are the heart of Kanban. Each column has a maximum number of items allowed. When a column is full, no new work can enter until something leaves.

### Why Limits Matter

Without limits, people take on too much work. Partially finished items pile up. Switching between tasks wastes time and energy. Nothing gets done quickly.

With limits:

- Team members focus on finishing before starting new work
- Bottlenecks become visible immediately
- Work flows faster through the system
- Quality improves because of focus

### Setting WIP Limits

There is no magic formula. Start with a simple rule: one or two items per person. Then observe and adjust.

If work flows smoothly with no idle time, your limits might be right. If people are always waiting for work, limits might be too low. If work piles up everywhere, limits might be too high.

A common pattern is to set column limits like this:

| Column | WIP Limit | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| To Do | 10 | Enough work ready, not overwhelming |
| In Progress | 4 | Team of 4, one item each |
| Review | 2 | Prevents review bottleneck |
| Done | No limit | Completed work is fine |

## Pull vs Push Systems

Kanban uses a **pull system**. Work is pulled into the next stage when there is capacity. This is different from a **push system** where work is assigned regardless of current workload.

In practice, this means team members look at the board and ask: "What is the highest priority item I can work on right now?" They pull it into their work column. No one assigns it to them.

## Continuous Flow vs Sprints

One major difference between Kanban and Scrum is how they handle time.

Scrum uses fixed-length sprints. Work is planned at the start, and the team commits to finishing it by the sprint end. No new work enters during the sprint.

Kanban uses continuous flow. Work enters the board when it is ready and exits when it is done. There are no artificial start and end points. New work can enter at any time (respecting WIP limits).

Neither approach is better. They fit different situations.

## Kanban Metrics

Kanban teams use several metrics to understand and improve their flow.

### Lead Time

Lead Time measures the total time from when a request is made until the work is delivered. It includes all waiting time and work time.

**Example:** A bug is reported on Monday. The fix is deployed on Friday. Lead Time = 5 days.

### Cycle Time

Cycle Time measures how long work takes once it actually starts. It begins when someone picks up the item and ends when it is done.

**Example:** A developer starts the bug fix on Wednesday and finishes on Thursday. Cycle Time = 2 days.

### Throughput

Throughput is how many items are completed in a time period. It shows the team's delivery rate.

**Example:** The team completed 15 items last week. Throughput = 15 items/week.

### Using Metrics

These metrics help the team answer important questions:

- "When will this feature be done?" - Use average lead time
- "How fast are we going?" - Track throughput over time
- "Where are the bottlenecks?" - Look at cycle time by column

## When to Use Kanban

Kanban works especially well for:

- **Maintenance and support work** - Bugs and requests arrive unpredictably
- **Operations teams** - Work is reactive and continuous
- **Teams with varying priorities** - Business needs change frequently
- **Starting with Agile** - Kanban requires less upfront change
- **Mixed work types** - Different kinds of tasks with different sizes

Kanban may not be the best choice when:

- The team needs strict timeboxing for focus
- Stakeholders expect sprint commitments
- Complex features need coordinated planning
- The team benefits from the rhythm of sprints

Many teams use a hybrid approach called "Scrumban" that combines elements of both.

## Kanban in DevOps

Kanban fits naturally with DevOps practices. The continuous flow philosophy matches the continuous delivery mindset.

DevOps teams use Kanban boards to track:

- Infrastructure changes
- Deployment requests
- Incident response
- Configuration updates
- Automation tasks

The visual nature helps teams see the entire flow from code commit to production deployment.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No WIP limits** - Without limits, you just have a to-do list on a board. The power of Kanban comes from limiting work.

2. **Limits too high** - If limits never cause you to stop and help, they are probably too high. Limits should create healthy tension.

3. **Ignoring blockers** - When work stops moving, investigate immediately. Blockers are visible for a reason.

4. **Not updating the board** - A board that does not reflect reality is useless. Update cards as work moves.

5. **Too many columns** - Start simple. Add columns only when you need visibility into a specific stage.

## Key Takeaways

- Kanban is a visual system for managing workflow that originated at Toyota
- The core principles are: visualize work, limit WIP, manage flow, make policies explicit, and improve collaboratively
- WIP limits prevent overload and make bottlenecks visible
- Kanban uses a pull system where workers take new work when they have capacity
- Continuous flow means work enters and exits the board without fixed iterations
- Lead Time, Cycle Time, and Throughput are key metrics for understanding flow
- Kanban works well for maintenance, support, and operations work
- DevOps teams often use Kanban to manage continuous delivery workflows

In the next lesson, you will learn how DevOps evolved from these SDLC models, combining development and operations into a unified approach.
