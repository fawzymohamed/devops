## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **SDLC** | Software Development Life Cycle - structured process for software creation |
| **Waterfall** | Sequential, linear approach with distinct phases |
| **Agile** | Iterative approach with continuous delivery and feedback |
| **Scrum** | Agile framework with sprints, roles, and ceremonies |
| **Kanban** | Visual workflow management with continuous flow |
| **DevOps** | Culture and practices unifying development and operations |
| **Sprint** | Fixed time period (1-4 weeks) for completing work |
| **Iteration** | Single development cycle producing working software |

## Model Comparison

| Model | Best For | Team Size | Flexibility | Delivery |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Waterfall** | Fixed requirements, regulated industries | Any | Low | Single release |
| **Agile** | Evolving requirements | Small-Medium | High | Iterative |
| **Scrum** | Complex projects, cross-functional teams | 5-9 per team | Medium-High | Sprint-based |
| **Kanban** | Continuous flow, support/maintenance | Any | Very High | Continuous |
| **DevOps** | Rapid delivery, automation-focused | Any | High | Continuous |

## Decision Guide

### Choose Waterfall when:
- Requirements are well-defined and stable
- Regulatory compliance requires documentation
- Project has fixed scope and timeline
- Stakeholders prefer upfront planning

### Choose Agile when:
- Requirements may change frequently
- Quick time-to-market is important
- Customer feedback is essential
- Working software is priority over documentation

### Choose Scrum when:
- Cross-functional collaboration is needed
- Work can be divided into sprints
- Team is dedicated and co-located
- Regular stakeholder involvement is possible

### Choose Kanban when:
- Work items vary in size and priority
- Continuous delivery is required
- Team handles support or maintenance
- No fixed iteration cycles needed

### Choose DevOps when:
- Fast, reliable deployments are critical
- Automation is a priority
- Development and operations need alignment
- Continuous improvement is valued

## SDLC Phases (Waterfall Sequence)

| Phase | Activities | Output |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Requirements** | Gather needs, document specs | Requirements doc |
| **Design** | Architecture, UI/UX design | Design documents |
| **Development** | Write code, unit tests | Source code |
| **Testing** | QA, integration tests | Test reports |
| **Deployment** | Release to production | Live system |
| **Maintenance** | Bug fixes, updates | Patches, versions |

## Agile Manifesto Values

| Value | Over |
|-------|------|
| **Individuals and interactions** | Processes and tools |
| **Working software** | Comprehensive documentation |
| **Customer collaboration** | Contract negotiation |
| **Responding to change** | Following a plan |

## Scrum Framework Quick Reference

### Roles
- **Product Owner** - Defines what to build
- **Scrum Master** - Facilitates process
- **Development Team** - Builds the product

### Events
- **Sprint Planning** - What to do this sprint
- **Daily Standup** - 15-min sync (yesterday, today, blockers)
- **Sprint Review** - Demo completed work
- **Retrospective** - How to improve

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog** - All desired features
- **Sprint Backlog** - Selected sprint work
- **Increment** - Working product

## Kanban Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Visualize work** | Use board with columns |
| **Limit WIP** | Restrict work in progress |
| **Manage flow** | Optimize throughput |
| **Make policies explicit** | Clear rules for each column |
| **Improve continuously** | Regular process refinement |

## DevOps Practices

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **CI/CD** | Automated build, test, deploy |
| **IaC** | Infrastructure as code |
| **Monitoring** | Observe system health |
| **Feedback loops** | Quick issue detection |
| **Collaboration** | Break down silos |

## Interview Quick Hits

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is SDLC? | A structured process that defines phases for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software systems |
| When would you choose Waterfall over Agile? | When requirements are fixed, regulatory compliance is needed, or stakeholders require upfront documentation |
| What are the four values of the Agile Manifesto? | Individuals over processes, working software over documentation, customer collaboration over contracts, responding to change over following a plan |
| What are the three Scrum roles? | Product Owner (defines what), Scrum Master (facilitates how), Development Team (builds it) |
| How does Kanban differ from Scrum? | Kanban uses continuous flow with WIP limits; Scrum uses fixed sprints with defined ceremonies |
| What is DevOps? | A culture and set of practices that unifies development and operations to enable faster, more reliable software delivery |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Waterfall with changing requirements | Consider Agile |
| Scrum without dedicated team | Ensure commitment |
| Kanban without WIP limits | Set and enforce limits |
| DevOps as tools only | Focus on culture first |
| Mixing models poorly | Choose deliberately |
