  questions:
    - question: "What is the main characteristic of the Waterfall Model?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Phases flow in one direction, like water falling down"
        - "Teams work in parallel on all phases at once"
        - "Requirements can change at any time during development"
        - "There is no documentation required"
      correctAnswer: "Phases flow in one direction, like water falling down"
      explanation: "The Waterfall Model is called 'waterfall' because each phase flows down to the next in a single direction. You complete one phase before moving to the next, with no going back."

    - question: "Which phase comes immediately after the Requirements phase in the Waterfall Model?"

        - "Design"
        - "Implementation"
        - "Deployment"
      correctAnswer: "Design"
      explanation: "In the Waterfall Model, the sequence is: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Design comes right after Requirements."

    - question: "Select all situations where the Waterfall Model works well."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Requirements are clear and unlikely to change"
        - "The project needs to adapt quickly to user feedback"
        - "Regulatory compliance requires detailed documentation"
        - "The technology and tools are well understood"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Requirements are clear and unlikely to change"
        - "Regulatory compliance requires detailed documentation"
        - "The technology and tools are well understood"
      explanation: "Waterfall works best when requirements are stable, documentation is important, and the technology is familiar. It does not work well when you need to adapt quickly to feedback."

    - question: "The Waterfall Model allows you to go back to earlier phases easily if you discover problems."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. One of the main drawbacks of Waterfall is that going back to earlier phases is difficult and expensive. Once you complete a phase, you move forward. This is why getting requirements right from the start is so important."

    - question: "What is a major disadvantage of the Waterfall Model?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "It requires too much collaboration between teams"
        - "Users see the product only at the end, making late changes costly"
        - "It produces too little documentation"
        - "It is too flexible and lacks structure"
      correctAnswer: "Users see the product only at the end, making late changes costly"
      explanation: "In Waterfall, the working software appears only at the end. If users do not like what they see or requirements were misunderstood, making changes at that point is very expensive."

# The Waterfall Model

The Waterfall Model is one of the oldest and simplest ways to develop software. It breaks the project into clear phases that follow each other in order. You finish one phase completely before starting the next. Think of water flowing down a series of steps - it only moves in one direction.

This model has been around since the 1970s and shaped how many organizations think about software projects. While newer methods have become popular, understanding Waterfall helps you see why those newer approaches exist.

## What is the Waterfall Model?

The Waterfall Model is a **linear and sequential** approach to software development. Each phase must be complete before the next one begins. There is no overlap between phases, and going back to a previous phase is difficult.

Imagine building a house. You would not start putting up walls before the foundation is ready. You would not install electrical wiring before the walls exist. The Waterfall Model applies this same logical order to software projects.

## The Six Phases of Waterfall

The Waterfall Model has six distinct phases. Each phase has specific goals and produces specific outputs before the project moves forward.

### 1. Requirements

In this phase, you gather and document everything the software needs to do. You talk to users, stakeholders, and business experts. The output is a detailed requirements document that describes exactly what the system should do.

**Key activities:** Interviews, surveys, document analysis, creating requirement specifications.

### 2. Design

Using the requirements, you plan how to build the system. This includes choosing technologies, designing the database, planning the user interface, and defining how different parts will work together.

**Key activities:** System architecture, database design, interface design, creating technical specifications.

### 3. Implementation

Developers write the actual code based on the design documents. This is where the software takes shape. Teams often split the work into modules that different programmers build separately.

**Key activities:** Coding, code reviews, unit testing by developers.

### 4. Testing

Once the code is complete, testers verify that the software works correctly. They check that it meets all the requirements from phase one. Any bugs found are sent back to developers for fixing.

**Key activities:** Integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing, bug fixing.

### 5. Deployment

The tested software goes live. Users can now access and use the system. This phase includes installing the software, migrating data, and training users.

**Key activities:** Installation, data migration, user training, go-live support.

### 6. Maintenance

After deployment, the team fixes bugs that users discover, makes small improvements, and keeps the software running smoothly. This phase can last for years.

**Key activities:** Bug fixes, performance improvements, minor updates, user support.

## When to Use the Waterfall Model

The Waterfall Model works well in certain situations:

**Real-world examples where Waterfall fits:**

- Building software for medical devices (strict regulations)
- Government contracts with fixed requirements
- Migrating data from one system to another
- Creating embedded software for hardware products

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Easy to understand:** The linear flow is simple to explain and follow
- **Clear milestones:** Each phase ends with a deliverable you can check
- **Good documentation:** Detailed documents help new team members understand the project
- **Works for stable projects:** When requirements will not change, Waterfall is efficient

### Disadvantages

- **Inflexible:** Going back to change earlier decisions is expensive
- **Late testing:** You find problems only after building the whole system
- **Long wait for results:** Users see working software only at the end
- **Risk of misunderstanding:** If requirements were wrong, you discover it too late

## Waterfall vs. Modern Approaches

Today, many teams prefer iterative approaches like Agile. These methods break work into small pieces and deliver working software frequently. Users give feedback early and often, reducing the risk of building the wrong thing.

However, Waterfall still has its place. Some projects genuinely need detailed upfront planning. Some industries require extensive documentation before any coding begins. Understanding Waterfall helps you choose the right approach for each situation.

## Key Takeaways

- The Waterfall Model is a linear, sequential approach where each phase completes before the next begins
- It has six phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance
- Waterfall works best when requirements are clear, stable, and unlikely to change
- The main drawback is inflexibility - discovering problems late is expensive to fix
- Modern iterative methods address Waterfall's limitations but Waterfall remains useful for certain projects

In the next lesson, you will learn about Agile Methodology, which takes a very different approach to handling change and delivering value.
