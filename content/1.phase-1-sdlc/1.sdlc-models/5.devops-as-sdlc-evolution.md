# DevOps as SDLC Evolution

DevOps is not just another methodology. It is an evolution of how software is built, delivered, and maintained. DevOps combines the speed of Agile development with the stability of reliable operations. It breaks down the barriers between the people who write code and the people who run it.

In this lesson, you will learn how DevOps emerged from earlier SDLC models, what problems it solves, and how its practices work together to deliver software faster and more reliably.

## The Evolution of Software Delivery

Software development has gone through several major shifts. Each evolution solved problems from the previous approach while creating new ways of working.

### From Waterfall to Agile

Waterfall gave us structure and documentation, but it was too slow. Teams spent months planning before writing any code. By the time software was delivered, requirements had changed.

Agile fixed this by embracing change. Teams delivered working software in short iterations. Customer feedback shaped the product. Development became faster and more responsive.

But Agile had a blind spot.

### Agile's Blind Spot: Operations

Agile focused on development teams. It improved how code was written and how features were planned. But it said little about what happened after code was written.

Development teams became very good at producing software quickly. But then that software had to be deployed. It had to run on servers. It had to be monitored and maintained.

These responsibilities fell to a separate group: the Operations team.

## The Wall of Confusion

In traditional organizations, development and operations were separate teams with different goals.

::

This created a pattern called "throwing code over the wall."

### How the Wall Created Problems

1. **Developers write code** without knowing how it will run in production
2. **Code is handed off** to operations for deployment
3. **Operations discovers problems** that developers never saw
4. **Blame is passed back and forth** when things break
5. **Releases become painful** and happen rarely

The result was slow releases, frustrated teams, and unreliable software. Developers blamed operations for being slow. Operations blamed developers for writing bad code. Neither team fully understood the other's work.

This was the "wall of confusion" that DevOps was created to tear down.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that brings development and operations together. The name combines "Dev" (development) and "Ops" (operations).

DevOps is not:
- A specific tool or technology
- A job title (though people do have that title)
- A replacement for Agile
- Just automation

DevOps is:
- A culture of collaboration
- Shared responsibility for the entire software lifecycle
- Practices that enable fast, reliable delivery
- A mindset that values both speed and stability

## The CALMS Framework

CALMS is a framework that describes the key aspects of DevOps. It helps organizations understand what DevOps really means.

### Culture

Culture is the foundation of DevOps. Without a culture of collaboration, tools and automation will not help.

Key cultural changes include:
- Developers and operations work on the same team
- Everyone is responsible for the software running in production
- Blame is replaced by learning from failures
- Experimentation is encouraged

### Automation

Automation removes repetitive manual work. Things that humans should not do repeatedly are done by machines.

Common automation areas:
- Building code
- Running tests
- Deploying applications
- Creating infrastructure
- Monitoring systems

### Lean

Lean principles from manufacturing apply to software delivery. The goal is to eliminate waste and focus on what creates value.

Waste in software delivery includes:
- Waiting for approvals
- Handoffs between teams
- Doing work that is never used
- Fixing the same problems repeatedly

### Measurement

You cannot improve what you do not measure. DevOps teams track metrics that matter.

Key metrics include:
- How often you deploy
- How long from commit to production
- How often deployments fail
- How quickly you recover from failures

### Sharing

Knowledge and tools should be shared across teams. When one team solves a problem, everyone should benefit.

Sharing includes:
- Documentation and runbooks
- Reusable code and scripts
- Post-incident reviews
- Tools and platforms

## CI/CD: The DevOps Engine

Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are core DevOps practices. Together they create a pipeline that moves code from development to production.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration means developers merge their code changes into a shared repository frequently, usually multiple times per day. Each merge triggers an automated build and test process.

Without CI:
- Developers work in isolation for weeks
- Merging becomes painful and error-prone
- Problems are found late

With CI:
- Small changes are merged often
- Problems are found immediately
- The codebase is always in a working state

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery means the software is always ready to deploy. After passing automated tests, the code could go to production at any time.

With Continuous Delivery:
- Releases are a business decision, not a technical challenge
- You can deploy weekly, daily, or on demand
- A human still approves each production release

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment goes one step further. Every change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production. No human approval is needed.

This requires:
- Very high confidence in automated tests
- Strong monitoring to catch problems quickly
- The ability to roll back fast

Not every organization needs Continuous Deployment. Many successful teams use Continuous Delivery with manual approval for production releases.

## Infrastructure as Code

In traditional operations, servers were configured by hand. Someone would log into a machine and run commands or click through interfaces. This created problems:

- No one knew exactly what was configured where
- Recreating environments was slow and error-prone
- "It works on my machine" was a common frustration

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solves this by defining infrastructure in code files.

footnote: IaC treats infrastructure the same way you treat application code

::

With IaC:
- Infrastructure is defined in files (YAML, JSON, HCL)
- Files are stored in version control
- Changes are reviewed like code changes
- Environments are created automatically
- Rebuilding from scratch is fast

Popular IaC tools include Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation. You will learn these tools in later phases of this roadmap.

## Feedback Loops

DevOps emphasizes fast feedback loops. The faster you learn about problems, the faster you can fix them.

    color: emerald

showFeedbackLoop: true
feedbackLabel: Continuous Learning
size: full

::

Types of feedback in DevOps:

- **Automated tests** tell you if code works (seconds to minutes)
- **Code review** catches design issues (hours)
- **Staging environments** find integration problems (hours to days)
- **Production monitoring** reveals real-world behavior (continuous)
- **User feedback** guides future development (ongoing)

The goal is to shorten all feedback loops. Problems found in production are more expensive to fix than problems found during development.

## Benefits of DevOps

Organizations that adopt DevOps see significant improvements:

- **Faster delivery**: Deploy in hours or days, not months
- **Higher quality**: Automated testing catches bugs early
- **Better reliability**: Smaller changes are easier to troubleshoot
- **Faster recovery**: When problems occur, fix them quickly
- **Improved collaboration**: Teams work together instead of blaming each other
- **Happier teams**: Less firefighting, more building

Research by DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) has shown that high-performing DevOps teams deploy 200 times more frequently than low performers, with 24 times faster recovery from failures.

## DevOps and Agile Together

DevOps does not replace Agile. They work together.

- **Agile** helps teams plan and build software iteratively
- **DevOps** ensures that software reaches users quickly and reliably

A team might use Scrum to organize their sprints while using CI/CD pipelines to deploy their work. The Scrum retrospective might identify deployment problems that DevOps practices can solve.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Buying tools without changing culture** - Tools alone do not create DevOps. Culture change comes first.

2. **Renaming the Ops team to DevOps** - Creating a "DevOps team" as a separate silo defeats the purpose.

3. **Automating a broken process** - Automating bad practices makes bad things happen faster.

4. **Ignoring security** - DevSecOps integrates security into DevOps. Security cannot be an afterthought.

5. **Expecting overnight transformation** - DevOps is a journey. Start small and improve continuously.

## Key Takeaways

- DevOps evolved from Waterfall and Agile to address the gap between development and operations
- The "wall of confusion" between Dev and Ops caused slow, painful releases
- CALMS (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing) describes what DevOps means
- CI/CD pipelines automate the path from code commit to production
- Infrastructure as Code treats servers and networks like software
- Fast feedback loops help teams learn and improve quickly
- DevOps complements Agile rather than replacing it
- Culture change is more important than tools

This completes the SDLC Models topic. In the next topic, you will learn about the specific phases of the software development lifecycle and how DevOps practices apply to each phase.
