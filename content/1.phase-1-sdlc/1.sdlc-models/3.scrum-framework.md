  questions:
    - question: "Who is responsible for managing the Product Backlog?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "The Scrum Master"
        - "The Product Owner"
        - "The Development Team"
        - "The Project Manager"
      correctAnswer: "The Product Owner"
      explanation: "The Product Owner owns the Product Backlog. They decide what features to build, set priorities, and ensure the backlog is clear and visible to everyone. The Scrum Master helps the process, but does not manage the backlog."

    - question: "What is timeboxing in Scrum?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "A way to track how many hours each person works"
        - "A fixed time limit for events and sprints"
        - "A tool for storing sprint data"
        - "A method for estimating user stories"
      correctAnswer: "A fixed time limit for events and sprints"
      explanation: "Timeboxing means every event and sprint has a maximum allowed time. For example, a Daily Scrum is timeboxed to 15 minutes, and sprints are typically 2-4 weeks. When the time runs out, the event ends."

    - question: "Select all items that are Scrum artifacts."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Product Backlog"
        - "Sprint Backlog"
        - "Increment"
        - "Daily Scrum"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Product Backlog"
        - "Sprint Backlog"
        - "Increment"
      explanation: "Scrum has three artifacts: Product Backlog (what could be built), Sprint Backlog (what will be built this sprint), and Increment (what has been built). Daily Scrum is an event, not an artifact."

    - question: "The Sprint Retrospective focuses on showing the completed work to stakeholders."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is false. The Sprint Review shows completed work to stakeholders. The Sprint Retrospective is about the team reflecting on how they worked together and finding ways to improve their process."

    - question: "What happens if the team cannot finish all Sprint Backlog items?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "The sprint is extended until all items are done"
        - "The Scrum Master is replaced"
        - "Unfinished items return to the Product Backlog for future sprints"
        - "The team must work overtime to complete everything"
      correctAnswer: "Unfinished items return to the Product Backlog for future sprints"
      explanation: "Sprints never extend. If work is not finished, it goes back to the Product Backlog. The Product Owner then decides if it should be included in the next sprint. This protects the team from endless deadlines."

# Scrum Framework

Scrum is the most popular framework for putting Agile into practice. It provides a simple structure that helps teams work together, deliver value regularly, and improve continuously. Millions of teams around the world use Scrum to build software and other products.

While Agile is a mindset with values and principles, Scrum is a specific framework with defined roles, events, and artifacts. Think of Scrum as a recipe that follows Agile's philosophy.

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a **lightweight framework** that helps teams deliver complex products in short cycles called sprints. The name comes from rugby, where a scrum is a formation where the team works together to move the ball forward.

In Scrum, a small team works in sprints of 1-4 weeks. Each sprint produces a working piece of the product. The team inspects their work and adapts their approach regularly.

The Scrum Guide, created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in 1995, defines everything about the framework. It is intentionally short (about 13 pages) because Scrum is meant to be simple.

## The Scrum Team

Every Scrum Team has exactly three roles. No project managers. No team leads. Just three roles with clear responsibilities.

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is the voice of the customer. They decide **what** the team builds and in what order. One person, not a committee.

Key responsibilities:
- Create and manage the Product Backlog
- Prioritize items based on business value
- Ensure the backlog is clear to everyone
- Accept or reject completed work
- Make decisions about product direction

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master serves the team by helping them follow Scrum properly. They are not a boss or project manager. They are a servant-leader and coach.

Key responsibilities:
- Facilitate Scrum events
- Remove obstacles blocking the team
- Protect the team from distractions
- Coach the team on Scrum practices
- Help the organization adopt Scrum

### Developers

Developers are the people who build the product. This includes programmers, testers, designers, and anyone else doing the work. They decide **how** to build what the Product Owner requests.

Key responsibilities:
- Create a plan for the sprint (Sprint Backlog)
- Build working software each sprint
- Meet quality standards and Definition of Done
- Self-organize to complete the work
- Hold each other accountable

## Scrum Artifacts

Artifacts are things the team creates and maintains. Scrum has three artifacts that make work visible and transparent.

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is a living, ordered list of everything the product might need. It is the single source of requirements. The Product Owner manages it.

Items at the top are:
- Well understood
- Small enough to finish in one sprint
- Ready for the team to work on

Items at the bottom might be vague ideas that need refinement later.

### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog contains:
- The items selected for this sprint
- A plan for delivering them
- The Sprint Goal

The Developers own the Sprint Backlog. They update it daily as they learn more about the work. No one else can change it during the sprint.

### Increment

The Increment is the sum of all completed work. Each sprint adds to the Increment. The Increment must:
- Work correctly
- Meet the Definition of Done
- Be potentially releasable

Even if the Product Owner decides not to release it, the Increment must be in a usable state.

## The Sprint

The sprint is the heartbeat of Scrum. It is a fixed-length cycle (usually 2 weeks) where the team creates a Done Increment.

### Sprint Rules

- Sprints have a consistent length (do not change mid-project)
- No changes are made that endanger the Sprint Goal
- Quality goals do not decrease
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed
- Scope may be clarified with the Product Owner

## Scrum Events

Scrum defines five events. Each event is **timeboxed**, meaning it has a maximum allowed duration. This creates focus and prevents endless meetings.

### Sprint Planning

**Timebox:** 8 hours maximum for a 1-month sprint (shorter for shorter sprints)

The entire team meets to answer two questions:
1. **What** can we deliver this sprint?
2. **How** will we do the work?

The team selects items from the Product Backlog and creates a Sprint Goal. Then they break the work into tasks.

### Daily Scrum

**Timebox:** 15 minutes

Every day, the Developers meet at the same time and place. They inspect progress and adapt their plan. A common format:

- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Are there any blockers?

The Scrum Master ensures the meeting happens but does not run it. The Developers run it themselves.

### Sprint Review

**Timebox:** 4 hours maximum for a 1-month sprint

At the end of the sprint, the team shows completed work to stakeholders. This is not a formal presentation but a working session.

Attendees:
- The Scrum Team
- Key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner

The Product Owner may accept or reject completed items. Feedback shapes future backlog items.

### Sprint Retrospective

**Timebox:** 3 hours maximum for a 1-month sprint

After the Sprint Review, the team reflects on the sprint. They discuss:

- What went well?
- What could be better?
- What will we improve next sprint?

The team picks specific improvements to try in the next sprint. This continuous improvement is how good teams become great.

## Timeboxing

Every event and sprint in Scrum has a maximum time limit. When time runs out, the event ends. This creates several benefits:

## Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is a shared checklist that describes when work is truly complete. Without it, "done" means different things to different people.

A typical Definition of Done might include:

::illustration-checklist
---
title: Definition of Done (Example)
items:
  - text: Code written and reviewed
    icon: "\U0001F4BB"
  - text: Unit tests passing
    icon: "\U00002705"
  - text: Integration tests passing
    icon: "\U0001F517"
  - text: Documentation updated
    icon: "\U0001F4DD"
  - text: Deployed to staging
    icon: "\U0001F680"
  - text: Product Owner accepted
    icon: "\U0001F44D"
note: Every item in the Increment must meet all criteria

size: 2xl

::

The whole team agrees on the Definition of Done. It applies to every item they complete. If something does not meet the Definition of Done, it is not included in the Increment.

## When to Use Scrum

Scrum works best for:

- Complex problems where the solution is not clear upfront
- Products that need frequent feedback from users
- Teams that can work together closely
- Projects where requirements will change
- Organizations ready to embrace self-organizing teams

Scrum may not fit when:

- Requirements are completely fixed and known
- The team cannot dedicate time to Scrum events
- Management will not empower the team to self-organize
- The work is simple and repetitive
- Stakeholders cannot provide regular feedback

## Scrum and DevOps

Scrum and DevOps work well together. Scrum provides the framework for organizing development work. DevOps provides the technical practices for delivering that work to production.
