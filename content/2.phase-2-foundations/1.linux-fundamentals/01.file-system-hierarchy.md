  questions:
    - question: "What is the root directory in Linux?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "/home"
        - "/root"
        - "/"
        - "/usr"
      correctAnswer: "/"
      explanation: "The forward slash (/) is the root directory in Linux. It is the top of the entire file system tree. All other directories branch from it. Note that /root is the home directory for the root user, not the root of the file system."

    - question: "Where are system configuration files typically stored?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "/var"
        - "/etc"
        - "/opt"
        - "/bin"
      correctAnswer: "/etc"
      explanation: "The /etc directory holds system-wide configuration files. Examples include /etc/passwd for user accounts, /etc/hosts for hostname mappings, and /etc/ssh for SSH settings."

    - question: "Select all directories that contain executable programs."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "/bin"
        - "/sbin"
        - "/usr/bin"
        - "/var"
      correctAnswers:
        - "/bin"
        - "/sbin"
        - "/usr/bin"
      explanation: "/bin contains essential user commands, /sbin contains essential system commands, and /usr/bin contains general user programs. The /var directory is for variable data like logs, not executables."

    - question: "The /tmp directory stores files that persist across system reboots."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "False. The /tmp directory is for temporary files that are often cleared on reboot. If you need temporary files to persist, use /var/tmp instead."

    - question: "Which directory contains log files in a typical Linux system?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "/etc/log"
        - "/var/log"
        - "/usr/log"
        - "/home/log"
      correctAnswer: "/var/log"
      explanation: "The /var/log directory contains system and application log files. Examples include /var/log/syslog for general messages and /var/log/auth.log for authentication logs."

# Linux File System Hierarchy

When you first look at a Linux system, you see many directories with short, cryptic names. Each of these directories has a specific purpose. Understanding this structure helps you find files quickly and know where to put things.

Linux follows a standard called the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**. This standard defines where different types of files should live. Most Linux distributions follow FHS, so what you learn here applies across systems.

## Why Does This Matter for DevOps?

As a DevOps engineer, you will work with Linux servers daily. You need to know:

- Where to find configuration files when setting up services
- Where logs are stored when troubleshooting problems
- Where to install custom applications
- Which directories need backup and which do not

## The Root of Everything: /

The forward slash `/` is the **root directory**. Every file and directory on the system lives under this single tree. Unlike Windows with C:, D:, and other drive letters, Linux has one unified hierarchy.

## Key Directories Explained

### /home - User Home Directories

Each user gets their own folder under `/home`. For example, user "ahmed" has `/home/ahmed`. This is where users store their personal files, documents, and settings.

```bash
# Your home directory
/home/username/

# Common folders inside
/home/username/Documents/
/home/username/Downloads/
/home/username/.bashrc          # User shell config (hidden file)
```

The tilde `~` is a shortcut for your home directory. So `cd ~` takes you home.

### /etc - Configuration Files

The `/etc` directory holds **system-wide configuration files**. When you install a service like nginx or SSH, its config files go here.

```bash
# Common configuration files
/etc/passwd        # User account information
/etc/shadow        # Encrypted passwords
/etc/hosts         # Static hostname to IP mappings
/etc/ssh/          # SSH server configuration
/etc/nginx/        # Nginx web server configuration
```

**DevOps tip:** When you automate server setup, you often copy or modify files in `/etc`.

### /var - Variable Data

The `/var` directory stores files that change frequently during normal system operation. Logs, caches, and spool files live here.

```bash
# Key subdirectories
/var/log/          # System and application logs
/var/cache/        # Application cache files
/var/spool/        # Queue files (print jobs, mail)
/var/lib/          # Application state data
/var/www/          # Web server content (on some systems)
```

**DevOps tip:** Monitor `/var/log` for troubleshooting. Watch `/var` disk space - logs can fill it up fast.

### /usr - User Programs

The `/usr` directory contains most user programs and data. Think of it as where applications live.

```bash
# Key subdirectories
/usr/bin/          # General user commands (most programs)
/usr/sbin/         # System administration programs
/usr/lib/          # Libraries for programs
/usr/share/        # Shared data (docs, icons)
/usr/local/        # Locally installed software
```

### /bin and /sbin - Essential Commands

These directories contain essential commands needed to boot and repair the system.

- `/bin` - Essential commands for all users (ls, cp, cat)
- `/sbin` - Essential commands for system administration (fdisk, ifconfig)

On modern systems, these are often links to `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.

### /tmp - Temporary Files

Programs store temporary files in `/tmp`. These files are usually deleted on reboot. Any user can write to this directory.

```bash
# Creating a temp file
echo "test data" > /tmp/myfile.txt

# Files here may disappear after reboot
```

**Security note:** Be careful with `/tmp`. Since anyone can write there, malicious files could exist. Do not run scripts from `/tmp` without inspection.

### /opt - Optional Software

The `/opt` directory is for add-on software packages. When you install third-party applications that are not part of the default system, they often go here.

```bash
# Examples
/opt/google/chrome/
/opt/datadog-agent/
/opt/custom-app/
```

### /root - Root User's Home

This is the home directory for the superuser (root). It is **not** the root of the filesystem - that is just `/`.

```bash
# Root user's home
/root/

# Do not confuse with:
/        # The root of the entire filesystem
```

## Mount Points and Filesystems

In Linux, storage devices are **mounted** into the directory tree. A hard drive partition might be mounted at `/home`, meaning all files in `/home` actually live on that partition.

```bash
# See mounted filesystems
df -h

# Example output
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G   15G   35G  30% /
/dev/sdb1       100G   20G   80G  20% /home
```

**DevOps tip:** Understanding mount points helps when planning disk allocation and backups.

## Quick Reference Table

| Directory | Purpose | Example Contents |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| `/` | Root of filesystem | All other directories |
| `/home` | User home directories | Personal files, user settings |
| `/etc` | Configuration files | nginx.conf, passwd, hosts |
| `/var` | Variable data | Logs, caches, databases |
| `/usr` | User programs | Most installed applications |
| `/bin` | Essential commands | ls, cp, cat, bash |
| `/sbin` | System commands | fdisk, mount, iptables |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files | Session data, downloads |
| `/opt` | Optional software | Third-party applications |
| `/root` | Root user's home | Root's personal files |

## Key Takeaways

- Linux uses a single directory tree starting at `/` (root)
- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines where different files belong
- Configuration files live in `/etc`, logs in `/var/log`, and user files in `/home`
- Understanding this structure is essential for troubleshooting and automation
- Mount points allow different storage devices to appear as part of the same tree

In the next lesson, you will learn how to navigate this filesystem using commands like `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`.
