quiz:
  passingScore: 70
  questions:
    - question: "Which package manager is used on Ubuntu systems?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "yum"
        - "dnf"
        - "apt"
        - "rpm"
      correctAnswer: "apt"
      explanation: "Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions use apt (and apt-get). yum and dnf are for RHEL/CentOS/Fedora. rpm is a low-level package format, not a full package manager."

    - question: "What command updates the package list without installing anything?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "apt install"
        - "apt update"
        - "apt upgrade"
        - "apt autoremove"
      correctAnswer: "apt update"
      explanation: "apt update refreshes the list of available packages from repositories. apt upgrade actually installs the updates. Always run update before upgrade to ensure you have the latest package information."

    - question: "Select all commands that install a package called nginx."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "apt install nginx"
        - "yum install nginx"
        - "dnf install nginx"
        - "apt update nginx"
      correctAnswers:
        - "apt install nginx"
        - "yum install nginx"
        - "dnf install nginx"
      explanation: "apt install (Debian/Ubuntu), yum install (older RHEL/CentOS), and dnf install (newer RHEL/Fedora) all install packages. apt update only refreshes package lists."

    - question: "Package managers automatically handle dependencies."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: true
      explanation: "True. This is a key benefit of package managers. When you install a package, the package manager automatically downloads and installs any required dependencies."

    - question: "What is the relationship between yum and dnf?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "They are completely different package managers"
        - "dnf is the newer replacement for yum"
        - "yum is for packages, dnf is for dependencies"
        - "dnf only works with Python packages"
      correctAnswer: "dnf is the newer replacement for yum"
      explanation: "dnf (Dandified YUM) is the next-generation version of yum with improved performance and dependency resolution. It's the default on Fedora and RHEL 8+, though yum commands often still work."

# Package Managers

Package managers are tools that install, update, and remove software. They handle dependencies automatically - if package A needs package B to work, the package manager installs both.

## Why Package Managers Matter in DevOps

Without package managers, you would need to:
- Download software manually
- Find and install all dependencies
- Track installed versions yourself
- Handle updates individually

Package managers automate all of this. In DevOps, you use them to:
- Set up servers with required software
- Keep systems updated and secure
- Create reproducible installations
- Automate server configuration

## Linux Distribution Families

Different Linux distributions use different package managers:

## Debian/Ubuntu: apt

The `apt` command is the modern package manager for Debian-based systems. The older `apt-get` still works but `apt` is friendlier.

### Updating Package Lists

Before installing anything, update your package lists:

```bash
# Refresh available package information
sudo apt update
```

This downloads the latest package lists from repositories. It does not install anything.

### Installing Packages

```bash
# Install a single package
sudo apt install nginx

# Install multiple packages
sudo apt install nginx curl git

# Install without prompting
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

### Upgrading Packages

```bash
# Upgrade all installed packages
sudo apt upgrade

# Update lists and upgrade in one command
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Removing Packages

```bash
# Remove package (keep config files)
sudo apt remove nginx

# Remove package and config files
sudo apt purge nginx

# Remove unused dependencies
sudo apt autoremove
```

### Searching and Information

```bash
# Search for packages
apt search nginx

# Show package information
apt show nginx

# List installed packages
apt list --installed

# Check if package is installed
dpkg -l | grep nginx
```

## RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: dnf and yum

Red Hat-based distributions use `dnf` (newer) or `yum` (older). Commands are nearly identical.

### Basic dnf Commands

```bash
# Check for updates
sudo dnf check-update

# Install a package
sudo dnf install nginx

# Install without prompting
sudo dnf install -y nginx

# Update all packages
sudo dnf update

# Remove a package
sudo dnf remove nginx

# Search for packages
dnf search nginx

# Get package info
dnf info nginx
```

### yum Commands (Older Systems)

On older RHEL/CentOS systems, use `yum`:

```bash
# Install
sudo yum install nginx

# Update
sudo yum update

# Remove
sudo yum remove nginx

# Search
yum search nginx
```

### Package Groups

Groups let you install related packages together:

```bash
# List available groups
dnf group list

# Install a group
sudo dnf group install "Development Tools"

# On yum
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

## Managing Repositories

Repositories are servers that host packages. You can add third-party repositories for software not in default repos.

### Debian/Ubuntu: Adding Repositories

```bash
# Add a repository
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:some/repository

# Or manually add to sources.list.d
echo "deb https://packages.example.com focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/example.list

# Then update package lists
sudo apt update
```

### RHEL/CentOS: Adding Repositories

```bash
# Add EPEL repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)
sudo dnf install epel-release

# Or add repo file
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://example.com/repo.repo
```

## Low-Level Package Commands

Sometimes you need to work with package files directly.

### dpkg (Debian)

```bash
# Install local .deb file
sudo dpkg -i package.deb

# Fix broken dependencies after dpkg
sudo apt install -f

# List files in a package
dpkg -L nginx

# Find which package owns a file
dpkg -S /usr/bin/nginx
```

### rpm (Red Hat)

```bash
# Install local .rpm file
sudo rpm -ivh package.rpm

# Query installed packages
rpm -qa | grep nginx

# List files in package
rpm -ql nginx

# Find which package owns a file
rpm -qf /usr/sbin/nginx
```

## Practical Examples

### Setting Up a Web Server

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf install -y nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

### Keeping a Server Updated

```bash
# Ubuntu - create update script
#!/bin/bash
apt update
apt upgrade -y
apt autoremove -y

# CentOS/RHEL
#!/bin/bash
dnf update -y
dnf autoremove -y
```

### Finding What Package Provides a File

```bash
# Ubuntu - if you need to find which package has a command
apt-file search /usr/bin/htop

# First install apt-file
sudo apt install apt-file
sudo apt-file update

# CentOS/RHEL
dnf provides /usr/bin/htop
```

## Comparison Table

| Task | Debian/Ubuntu | RHEL/CentOS |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Update package lists | `apt update` | `dnf check-update` |
| Upgrade all | `apt upgrade` | `dnf update` |
| Install | `apt install nginx` | `dnf install nginx` |
| Remove | `apt remove nginx` | `dnf remove nginx` |
| Search | `apt search nginx` | `dnf search nginx` |
| Package info | `apt show nginx` | `dnf info nginx` |
| List installed | `apt list --installed` | `dnf list installed` |

## Key Takeaways

- Package managers automate software installation, updates, and removal
- Debian/Ubuntu uses `apt` (and dpkg); RHEL/CentOS uses `dnf` or `yum` (and rpm)
- Always update package lists before installing: `apt update` or `dnf check-update`
- Package managers handle dependencies automatically
- Repositories can be added for third-party software
- Know both apt and dnf/yum - you will encounter both in DevOps work

In the next lesson, you will learn about system services and how to manage them with systemd.
