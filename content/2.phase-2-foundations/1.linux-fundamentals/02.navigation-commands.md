quiz:
  passingScore: 70
  questions:
    - question: "What does the pwd command do?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Prints the current working directory"
        - "Changes the current directory"
        - "Creates a new directory"
        - "Lists files in a directory"
      correctAnswer: "Prints the current working directory"
      explanation: "pwd stands for 'print working directory'. It shows the full path of your current location in the filesystem."

    - question: "Which command would take you to your home directory from anywhere?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "cd /"
        - "cd ~"
        - "cd home"
        - "cd .."
      correctAnswer: "cd ~"
      explanation: "The tilde (~) is a shortcut for your home directory. Running 'cd ~' or just 'cd' without arguments takes you to your home directory."

    - question: "Select all options that show hidden files when using ls."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "ls -a"
        - "ls -l"
        - "ls -la"
        - "ls -h"
      correctAnswers:
        - "ls -a"
        - "ls -la"
      explanation: "The -a option shows all files including hidden ones (those starting with a dot). ls -la combines -l (long format) with -a. The -l alone only changes the format, and -h only makes sizes human-readable."

    - question: "An absolute path always starts with a forward slash (/)."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: true
      explanation: "True. Absolute paths start from the root directory (/) and specify the complete path to a file or directory. Relative paths, on the other hand, start from your current location."

    - question: "What does 'cd ..' do?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Goes to the root directory"
        - "Goes to the home directory"
        - "Goes up one directory level"
        - "Shows the current directory"
      correctAnswer: "Goes up one directory level"
      explanation: "The double dot (..) represents the parent directory. Using 'cd ..' moves you up one level in the directory tree. A single dot (.) represents the current directory."

# Navigation Commands

Moving around the Linux filesystem is something you will do constantly. Three commands form the foundation of navigation: `pwd` to see where you are, `ls` to see what is around you, and `cd` to move somewhere else.

These commands are like basic walking skills. Once you master them, everything else becomes easier.

## Where Am I? The pwd Command

The `pwd` command stands for **print working directory**. It shows your current location in the filesystem.

```bash
# Show current directory
pwd

# Example output
/home/ahmed/projects
```

When you open a terminal, you usually start in your home directory. Running `pwd` confirms your location before you start working.

**DevOps tip:** In scripts, use `pwd` to log where operations are happening or to build paths dynamically.

## Looking Around: The ls Command

The `ls` command **lists** the contents of a directory. Without any options, it shows files and folders in the current directory.

```bash
# Basic list
ls

# Example output
Documents  Downloads  Pictures  scripts  notes.txt
```

### Essential ls Options

The real power of `ls` comes from its options. Here are the most useful ones:

```bash
# Long format with details
ls -l

# Example output
drwxr-xr-x 2 ahmed ahmed 4096 Jan 15 10:30 Documents
-rw-r--r-- 1 ahmed ahmed  156 Jan 14 09:15 notes.txt
```

The long format shows permissions, owner, size, date, and name.

```bash
# Show hidden files (those starting with a dot)
ls -a

# Example output
.  ..  .bashrc  .ssh  Documents  notes.txt
```

```bash
# Human-readable file sizes
ls -lh

# Example output (sizes in K, M, G instead of bytes)
-rw-r--r-- 1 ahmed ahmed 2.5K Jan 14 09:15 notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 ahmed ahmed 1.2M Jan 13 14:20 backup.tar.gz
```

```bash
# Combine options: long format, hidden files, human sizes
ls -lah

# List contents of a specific directory
ls -l /var/log
```

## Moving Around: The cd Command

The `cd` command **changes directory**. It moves you from one location to another.

```bash
# Change to a specific directory
cd /var/log

# Verify the change
pwd
# Output: /var/log
```

### Absolute vs Relative Paths

Understanding paths is essential for navigation.

**Absolute paths** start from the root `/` and give the complete location:

```bash
# Absolute path - works from anywhere
cd /home/ahmed/Documents

# Always starts with /
cd /etc/nginx
```

**Relative paths** start from your current location:

```bash
# If you are in /home/ahmed
cd Documents
# Now you are in /home/ahmed/Documents

# Go into a subdirectory
cd projects/website
```

### Special Directory Shortcuts

Linux provides several shortcuts for common navigation:

```bash
# Go to your home directory
cd ~
# or simply
cd

# Go up one directory level
cd ..

# Go up two levels
cd ../..

# Go to the previous directory
cd -

# Stay in current directory (rarely used alone)
cd .
```

### Practical Examples

```bash
# Starting from home
cd ~
pwd
# Output: /home/ahmed

# Go to /var/log
cd /var/log
pwd
# Output: /var/log

# Go up one level
cd ..
pwd
# Output: /var

# Go back to the previous directory
cd -
pwd
# Output: /var/log

# Go home again
cd
pwd
# Output: /home/ahmed
```

## Putting It All Together

Here is a typical workflow when exploring a new server:

```bash
# See where you are
pwd

# List what is here
ls -la

# Go to a directory
cd /etc/nginx

# List configuration files
ls -la

# Check a subdirectory
ls -l sites-available/

# Go back home
cd ~
```

## Tab Completion

Most Linux shells support **tab completion**. Start typing a path and press Tab to auto-complete:

```bash
# Type this and press Tab
cd /var/lo

# Shell completes to
cd /var/log/
```

If multiple matches exist, press Tab twice to see options. This saves typing and reduces errors.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting spaces**: `cd/var/log` is wrong. Use `cd /var/log` (space after cd).

2. **Case sensitivity**: Linux is case-sensitive. `Documents` and `documents` are different directories.

3. **Missing slash in absolute paths**: `/var/log` is absolute. `var/log` is relative and might not exist from your current location.

4. **Spaces in directory names**: Use quotes or escape spaces:
   ```bash
   cd "My Documents"
   # or
   cd My\ Documents
   ```

## Key Takeaways

- `pwd` shows your current directory - use it when lost
- `ls` lists contents with many useful options (-l, -a, -h)
- `cd` changes directories using absolute or relative paths
- The tilde `~` is a shortcut for your home directory
- Double dot `..` represents the parent directory
- Tab completion saves time and prevents typos

In the next lesson, you will learn file operations like copying, moving, and deleting files.
