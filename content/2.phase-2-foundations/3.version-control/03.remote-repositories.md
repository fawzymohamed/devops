  questions:
    - question: "What command adds a new remote called 'origin'?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "git remote origin add url"
        - "git add remote origin url"
        - "git remote add origin url"
        - "git origin add url"
      correctAnswer: "git remote add origin url"
      explanation: "The syntax is 'git remote add <name> <url>'. 'origin' is the conventional name for the primary remote repository."

    - question: "What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "There is no difference"
        - "fetch downloads and merges, pull only downloads"
        - "fetch only downloads, pull downloads and merges"
        - "fetch is for branches, pull is for tags"
      correctAnswer: "fetch only downloads, pull downloads and merges"
      explanation: "git fetch downloads new data from the remote but does not merge it into your working branch. git pull does both - it fetches and then merges the changes."

    - question: "Select all true statements about the 'origin' remote."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "It is the default name for the first remote"
        - "It is required by Git"
        - "You can rename it to something else"
        - "It is automatically created when you clone"
      correctAnswers:
        - "It is the default name for the first remote"
        - "You can rename it to something else"
        - "It is automatically created when you clone"
      explanation: "Origin is a convention, not a requirement. Git creates it when you clone, but you can rename it or add remotes with any name you want."

    - question: "The -u flag in 'git push -u origin main' sets up tracking between local and remote branches."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: true
      explanation: "True. The -u (or --set-upstream) flag creates a tracking relationship. After this, you can just run 'git push' and 'git pull' without specifying the remote and branch."

    - question: "What command shows all configured remotes with their URLs?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "git remote show"
        - "git remote -v"
        - "git remote list"
        - "git remotes"
      correctAnswer: "git remote -v"
      explanation: "git remote -v lists all remotes with their fetch and push URLs. The -v stands for verbose."

# Remote Repositories

So far, you have worked with Git locally. But real projects need to share code with others. Remote repositories let you store your code on a server where others can access it.

## Why Remote Repositories Matter

Remote repositories enable:

- **Backup**: Your code lives on a server, not just your laptop
- **Collaboration**: Team members can push and pull changes
- **CI/CD**: Pipelines trigger when code is pushed
- **Code Review**: Pull requests happen on remote platforms

Popular remote hosting services include GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps.

## Understanding Remotes

A remote is a connection to a repository on a server. When you clone a repository, Git automatically creates a remote called `origin`:

```bash
# Clone creates the origin remote
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo

# See configured remotes
git remote -v
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
```

## Adding a Remote

If you created a local repository with `git init`, you need to add a remote:

```bash
# Add a remote called origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-project.git

# Verify it was added
git remote -v
```

You can add multiple remotes:

```bash
# Add another remote for a different server
git remote add backup https://gitlab.com/username/my-project.git
```

## Remote Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git remote` | List remote names |
| `git remote -v` | List remotes with URLs |
| `git remote add name url` | Add a remote |
| `git remote remove name` | Remove a remote |
| `git remote rename old new` | Rename a remote |
| `git remote show origin` | Show remote details |

## Pushing to a Remote

Push sends your local commits to the remote:

```bash
# Push to origin, main branch
git push origin main

# First push with tracking (-u sets upstream)
git push -u origin main

# After -u, just use:
git push
```

### Understanding Upstream

The `-u` flag sets up **tracking**. This links your local branch to a remote branch:

```bash
# Set upstream and push
git push -u origin feature/login

# Now Git knows the connection
git branch -vv
# feature/login  a1b2c3d [origin/feature/login] Add login form
```

After setting upstream, you can simply run `git push` and `git pull` without extra arguments.

## Fetching from a Remote

Fetch downloads new data but does not change your working files:

```bash
# Fetch from origin
git fetch origin

# Fetch from all remotes
git fetch --all
```

After fetching, you have the remote data locally, but your branches have not changed. Use this when you want to see what others did without affecting your work.

```bash
# See what's new after fetch
git log origin/main --oneline

# Compare your branch to remote
git diff main origin/main
```

## Pulling from a Remote

Pull fetches and merges in one step:

```bash
# Pull from tracked remote branch
git pull

# Pull from specific remote and branch
git pull origin main
```

Pull is the same as:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

## Remote Branches

Remote branches are read-only references to the state of branches on remotes:

```bash
# See all branches including remotes
git branch -a

# Example output
* main
  feature/login
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/develop
```

Remote branches are prefixed with the remote name (e.g., `origin/main`).

## Working with Remote Branches

To work on a remote branch locally:

```bash
# Fetch latest
git fetch origin

# Create local branch tracking remote
git checkout -b feature origin/feature

# Or the shorter version
git checkout feature
# This automatically tracks origin/feature if it exists
```

## Practical Example

Complete workflow with remote:

```bash
# Start fresh - clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
cd project

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-readme

# Make changes
echo "# My Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add project README"

# Push the branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/add-readme

# Later, update from remote
git fetch origin

# Switch to main and get updates
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## Handling Push Rejection

If someone else pushed changes while you worked, your push may be rejected:

```bash
git push
# ! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)
```

Solution:

```bash
# Get the remote changes first
git pull origin main

# Resolve any conflicts if needed
# Then push again
git push origin main
```

## Cloning vs Adding Remote

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `git clone url` | Getting an existing project for the first time |
| `git remote add` | Connecting a local repo to a remote |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pushing to wrong branch**: Double-check your branch before pushing
2. **Not pulling before work**: Start each day with `git pull`
3. **Force pushing to shared branches**: This rewrites history others depend on
4. **Forgetting to set upstream**: Use `-u` on first push

## Key Takeaways

- Remote repositories store code on servers for backup and collaboration
- `origin` is the conventional name for the primary remote
- `git push` sends local commits to the remote
- `git pull` fetches and merges remote changes
- `git fetch` downloads but does not merge
- Use `-u` to set up tracking between local and remote branches

In the next lesson, you will learn about Git Flow, a popular branching workflow for managing features and releases.
