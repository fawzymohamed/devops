  questions:
    - question: "In Git Flow, which branch contains production-ready code?"

        - "develop"
        - "main (or master)"
        - "feature"
        - "release"
      correctAnswer: "main (or master)"
      explanation: "The main branch always contains production-ready code. Every commit on main represents a version that could be deployed to production."

    - question: "Feature branches are created from which branch in Git Flow?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "main"
        - "develop"
        - "release"
        - "hotfix"
      correctAnswer: "develop"
      explanation: "Feature branches branch off from develop and merge back into develop. This keeps the main branch clean for production code only."

    - question: "Select all branches that exist permanently in Git Flow."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "main"
        - "develop"
        - "feature"
        - "release"
      correctAnswers:
        - "main"
        - "develop"
      explanation: "Main and develop are permanent branches. Feature, release, and hotfix branches are temporary - they are created for specific work and deleted after merging."

    - question: "Hotfix branches merge into both main and develop."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: true
      explanation: "True. Hotfixes must go to main (to fix production) and develop (so the fix is in future releases). This prevents the bug from reappearing in the next release."

    - question: "When should you use a release branch?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "When fixing a critical production bug"
        - "When preparing a new version for deployment"
        - "When starting a new feature"
        - "When merging into main"
      correctAnswer: "When preparing a new version for deployment"
      explanation: "Release branches are created when preparing a new version. They allow final testing and bug fixes while development continues on other features in develop."

# Git Flow Workflow

Git Flow is a branching model that defines a strict branching structure for projects. It was introduced by Vincent Driessen in 2010 and has become one of the most popular workflows for managing releases.

## Why Use Git Flow?

Git Flow works well when you have:

- Scheduled releases (not continuous deployment)
- Multiple developers working on features
- Need for hotfixes to production
- Long-lived release cycles

It provides clear rules about which branch to use and when.

## The Five Branch Types

Git Flow uses five types of branches:

::

### Main Branch

- Contains production-ready code
- Every commit is a release
- Never commit directly here
- Only receives merges from release or hotfix branches

### Develop Branch

- Integration branch for features
- Contains the latest development changes
- Feature branches merge here
- Release branches start here

### Feature Branches

- One branch per feature
- Branch from develop
- Merge back to develop
- Naming: `feature/feature-name`

### Release Branches

- Prepare for a new production release
- Branch from develop
- Merge to both main and develop
- Allow bug fixes, no new features
- Naming: `release/version-number`

### Hotfix Branches

- Fix critical bugs in production
- Branch from main
- Merge to both main and develop
- Naming: `hotfix/issue-description`

## Feature Branch Workflow

Working on a new feature:

```bash
# Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on the feature
# ... make commits ...

# Keep up with develop
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop

# When done, merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication

# Delete the feature branch
git branch -d feature/user-authentication

# Push develop
git push origin develop
```

## Release Branch Workflow

Preparing a release:

```bash
# Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/1.2.0

# Make release preparations
# - Update version numbers
# - Final bug fixes
# - Update documentation

git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge release/1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Version 1.2.0"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.2.0

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release/1.2.0

# Push everything
git push origin main develop --tags
```

## Hotfix Branch Workflow

Fixing a critical production bug:

```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-login-crash

# Fix the bug
git commit -m "Fix null pointer in login handler"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/fix-login-crash
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix: login crash"

# Merge to develop (so fix is in future releases)
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/fix-login-crash

# Delete hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/fix-login-crash

# Push everything
git push origin main develop --tags
```

## Branch Relationships

```
main    ─────●─────────────────●───────●────
              \               /       /
hotfix         \             /   ●───●
                \           /   /
release          \     ●───●───●
                  \   /       \
develop    ●───●───●───●───●───●───●───●────
              / \     / \
feature      ●   ●───●   ●───●
```

- Features branch from and merge to develop
- Releases branch from develop, merge to main and develop
- Hotfixes branch from main, merge to main and develop

## Git Flow Commands

You can use the git-flow extension for easier commands:

```bash
# Initialize git flow in a repo
git flow init

# Feature commands
git flow feature start feature-name
git flow feature finish feature-name

# Release commands
git flow release start 1.2.0
git flow release finish 1.2.0

# Hotfix commands
git flow hotfix start fix-name
git flow hotfix finish fix-name
```

Or use standard Git commands as shown in the examples above.

## When to Use Git Flow

| Use Git Flow When | Consider Alternatives When |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Scheduled releases | Continuous deployment |
| Multiple versions in production | Single production version |
| Long release cycles | Frequent small releases |
| Need for hotfixes | Simple linear development |
| Large team with parallel features | Small team, few features |

## Simplified Alternatives

### GitHub Flow

Simpler model with just main and feature branches:

1. Create branch from main
2. Make commits
3. Open pull request
4. Review and discuss
5. Merge to main
6. Deploy

### Trunk-Based Development

Even simpler - everyone works on main with short-lived branches.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Committing directly to main**: Always use branches
2. **Long-lived feature branches**: Merge frequently to avoid conflicts
3. **Forgetting to merge hotfix to develop**: Bugs will reappear in next release
4. **Not pulling before branching**: Start from latest code
5. **Skipping releases for hotfixes**: Hotfixes should be minimal, focused changes

## Key Takeaways

- Git Flow uses main (production), develop (integration), and temporary branches
- Feature branches start from develop and merge back to develop
- Release branches prepare for production and merge to both main and develop
- Hotfix branches fix production issues and merge to both main and develop
- Use tags to mark release versions
- Consider simpler workflows like GitHub Flow for continuous deployment

In the next lesson, you will learn about rebasing and how it differs from merging.
