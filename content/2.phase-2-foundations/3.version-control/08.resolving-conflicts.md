        - "When you push to remote"
      correctAnswer: "When the same lines are changed differently in both branches"

        - "Edit files to resolve conflicts"
        - "Stage resolved files with git add"

      explanation: "You must manually edit files, stage them with git add, then commit. For merge, you run git commit (or git merge --continue). The --continue command is used for rebase."

    - question: "The git merge --abort command undoes a merge in progress and restores your branch."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: true
      explanation: "True. If you want to cancel a merge that has conflicts, git merge --abort will stop the merge and return your branch to the state before you started merging."

    - question: "What separates your changes from incoming changes in a conflict?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "<<<<<<<<"
        - "========"
        - ">>>>>>>>"
        - "--------"
      correctAnswer: "========"
      explanation: "The ======= line separates your current changes (above) from the incoming changes (below). You need to choose what to keep and remove all markers."

# Resolving Conflicts

Conflicts happen when Git cannot automatically merge changes. This occurs when two branches modify the same lines in different ways. Git stops and asks you to decide what the final result should be.

## Why Conflicts Happen

Git is smart about merging. It can combine changes automatically when they are in different parts of a file. But when changes overlap, Git cannot decide which version is correct.

```
Branch A changed line 10 to: "Hello World"
Branch B changed line 10 to: "Hello Universe"

Git: "I don't know which one to keep. Human, please help!"
```

## Recognizing a Conflict

When a merge has conflicts, Git tells you:

```bash
git merge feature/login
# Auto-merging app.js
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in app.js
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit.
```

Check status to see which files have conflicts:

```bash
git status
# Unmerged paths:
#   both modified:   app.js
```

## Understanding Conflict Markers

Open the conflicted file. You will see markers like this:

```javascript
function greet() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return "Hello from main branch";
=======
    return "Hello from feature branch";
>>>>>>> feature/login
}
```

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `<<<<<<< HEAD` | Start of your current branch changes |
| `=======` | Divider between the two versions |
| `>>>>>>> branch-name` | End of incoming branch changes |

## Resolving Conflicts Manually

To resolve, you must:

1. **Choose what to keep** - one version, both, or a combination
2. **Remove the conflict markers** - delete all `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. **Stage the resolved file** - `git add filename`
4. **Complete the merge** - `git commit`

### Example: Keep One Version

Keep only your version:

```javascript
function greet() {
    return "Hello from main branch";
}
```

Or keep only their version:

```javascript
function greet() {
    return "Hello from feature branch";
}
```

### Example: Keep Both

Combine both changes:

```javascript
function greet() {
    return "Hello from main and feature branches";
}
```

Or keep both separately:

```javascript
function greetMain() {
    return "Hello from main branch";
}

function greetFeature() {
    return "Hello from feature branch";
}
```

## Complete Resolution Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start the merge (conflict happens)
git merge feature/login
# CONFLICT in app.js

# 2. See which files have conflicts
git status

# 3. Open and edit each conflicted file
# ... manually edit app.js ...
# Remove all <<<<<<, ======, >>>>>> markers

# 4. Stage resolved files
git add app.js

# 5. Check all conflicts are resolved
git status
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging

# 6. Complete the merge
git commit -m "Merge feature/login, resolve conflicts"
```

## Using Merge Tools

GUI tools can make conflicts easier to resolve:

```bash
# Open merge tool
git mergetool

# Configure a specific tool
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'
```

Popular merge tools:
- VS Code (built-in)
- IntelliJ/WebStorm
- KDiff3
- Meld
- Beyond Compare

VS Code shows conflicts with helpful buttons:
- "Accept Current Change"
- "Accept Incoming Change"
- "Accept Both Changes"
- "Compare Changes"

## Aborting a Merge

If you want to cancel the merge:

```bash
# Stop the merge, go back to before you started
git merge --abort
```

This restores your branch to the state before the merge attempt.

## Conflicts During Rebase

Rebase conflicts work similarly but may occur multiple times (once per commit being replayed):

```bash
git rebase main
# CONFLICT in app.js

# Resolve the conflict
# ... edit file ...
git add app.js

# Continue the rebase
git rebase --continue

# Or abort
git rebase --abort
```

## Handling Complex Conflicts

For files with many conflicts:

```bash
# See base, ours, and theirs versions
git show :1:filename  # Common ancestor
git show :2:filename  # Ours (HEAD)
git show :3:filename  # Theirs (incoming)

# Use theirs version entirely
git checkout --theirs filename

# Use ours version entirely
git checkout --ours filename
```

## Common Conflict Scenarios

### Both Added Same File

```bash
# CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in newfile.txt
```

Both branches created the same file. You need to combine them or choose one.

### File Deleted in One Branch

```bash
# CONFLICT (modify/delete): file.txt deleted in feature
```

One branch modified, another deleted. Choose to keep or delete.

### Binary Files

```bash
# warning: Cannot merge binary files: image.png
```

Git cannot merge binary files. Choose one version:

```bash
git checkout --ours image.png
# or
git checkout --theirs image.png
```

## Reviewing Conflict History

After resolving, review what happened:

```bash
# See the merge commit
git log --oneline -1

# See files changed in merge
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD

# See the merge structure
git log --graph --oneline
```

## Key Takeaways

- Conflicts happen when the same lines change differently in two branches
- Conflict markers show your changes (HEAD) and incoming changes
- Remove all markers and keep the code you want
- Stage resolved files with `git add`, then commit
- Use `git merge --abort` to cancel a problematic merge
- Prevent conflicts by integrating frequently and keeping branches short

In the next lesson, you will learn about Git hooks to automate actions at key points in your workflow.
