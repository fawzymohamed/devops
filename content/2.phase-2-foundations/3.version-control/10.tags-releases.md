  questions:
    - question: "What is the difference between lightweight and annotated tags?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Lightweight tags can be pushed, annotated cannot"
        - "Annotated tags store extra metadata like author and message"
        - "Lightweight tags are for releases, annotated for testing"
        - "There is no difference"
      correctAnswer: "Annotated tags store extra metadata like author and message"
      explanation: "Annotated tags store the tagger name, email, date, and a message. Lightweight tags are just pointers to commits with no additional data."

    - question: "What command creates an annotated tag called v1.0.0?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "git tag v1.0.0"
        - "git tag -a v1.0.0"
        - "git tag --annotated v1.0.0"
        - "git create-tag v1.0.0"
      correctAnswer: "git tag -a v1.0.0"
      explanation: "The -a flag creates an annotated tag. Without -a, git tag creates a lightweight tag. You typically also add -m for the message."

    - question: "Select all true statements about git tags."
      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Tags are not pushed by default with git push"
        - "Tags point to specific commits"
        - "Tags can be moved to different commits easily"
        - "Deleting a tag requires special syntax"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Tags are not pushed by default with git push"
        - "Tags point to specific commits"
        - "Deleting a tag requires special syntax"
      explanation: "Tags point to commits and need explicit pushing (--tags). Deleting uses -d flag. Unlike branches, tags should not be moved - they mark fixed points in history."

    - question: "In semantic versioning (v1.2.3), what does the middle number represent?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Major version (breaking changes)"
        - "Minor version (new features)"
        - "Patch version (bug fixes)"
        - "Build number"
      correctAnswer: "Minor version (new features)"
      explanation: "In MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format, the minor version increments when you add functionality in a backward-compatible way. Major is for breaking changes, patch is for bug fixes."

    - question: "Tags need to be pushed separately from regular commits."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: true
      explanation: "True. Regular git push does not include tags. You must use git push --tags or git push origin tagname to push tags to the remote."

# Tags & Releases

Tags mark specific points in your project's history. They are typically used to mark release versions like v1.0.0 or v2.1.3. Unlike branches, tags do not change - they are permanent markers.

## Why Use Tags?

- **Mark releases**: Know exactly which commit is version 1.0.0
- **Documentation**: Record important milestones
- **Deployment**: Deploy specific tagged versions
- **Rollback**: Easily return to a known good version

## Types of Tags

Git has two types of tags:

::illustration-comparison-map
---
leftTitle: Lightweight Tag
rightTitle: Annotated Tag
leftColor: gray
rightColor: emerald
connections:
  - left: Just a pointer
    right: Full object with metadata
    icon: "\U0001F4E6"
  - left: No message
    right: Has tagger, date, message
    icon: "\U0001F4DD"
  - left: Quick bookmarks
    right: Official releases
    icon: "\U0001F3F7\uFE0F"
footnote: Use annotated tags for releases

::

### Lightweight Tags

Simple pointer to a commit. No additional information.

```bash
# Create lightweight tag
git tag v1.0.0
```

### Annotated Tags

Stores extra metadata: tagger name, email, date, and message.

```bash
# Create annotated tag with message
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First stable release"
```

**Use annotated tags for releases.** They are more informative and can be signed for security.

## Creating Tags

### Tag Current Commit

```bash
# Lightweight
git tag v1.0.0

# Annotated (recommended)
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
```

### Tag a Specific Commit

```bash
# Find the commit hash
git log --oneline

# Tag that commit
git tag -a v1.0.0 abc1234 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
```

### Tag with Longer Message

```bash
# Opens editor for message
git tag -a v1.0.0

# Or use multiple -m flags
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0" -m "Major features: login, dashboard"
```

## Listing Tags

```bash
# List all tags
git tag

# List tags matching pattern
git tag -l "v1.*"

# Show tag with details
git show v1.0.0
```

Example output of `git show v1.0.0`:

```
tag v1.0.0
Tagger: Ahmed Ali <ahmed@example.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 15 10:00:00 2024 +0300

Release version 1.0.0

commit abc1234def5678...
Author: Sara <sara@example.com>
Date:   Sun Jan 14 18:00:00 2024 +0300

    Add login feature
```

## Pushing Tags

Tags are not pushed with regular `git push`. You must push them explicitly:

```bash
# Push a specific tag
git push origin v1.0.0

# Push all tags
git push --tags

# Push all annotated tags only
git push --follow-tags
```

## Deleting Tags

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Delete remote tag
git push origin --delete v1.0.0

# Or use this syntax
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
```

## Checking Out Tags

To view code at a tagged version:

```bash
# Checkout a tag (detached HEAD state)
git checkout v1.0.0

# Create a branch from a tag
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.0.1 v1.0.0
```

When you checkout a tag directly, you are in "detached HEAD" state. Make a branch if you need to make changes.

## Semantic Versioning

Most projects use **semantic versioning** (SemVer): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

| Component | When to Increment | Example |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| MAJOR | Breaking changes | v1.0.0 → v2.0.0 |
| MINOR | New features (backward compatible) | v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 |
| PATCH | Bug fixes | v1.0.0 → v1.0.1 |

```bash
# Version examples
v1.0.0    # Initial release
v1.0.1    # Bug fix
v1.1.0    # New feature
v2.0.0    # Breaking change
```

### Pre-release Versions

```bash
v1.0.0-alpha      # Alpha testing
v1.0.0-beta       # Beta testing
v1.0.0-rc.1       # Release candidate 1
```

## Release Workflow

Typical release process:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you are on main with latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Make sure tests pass
npm test

# 3. Update version in package.json (if applicable)
# ... edit package.json ...
git add package.json
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"

# 4. Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release 1.2.0: Add user profiles feature"

# 5. Push commit and tag
git push origin main
git push origin v1.2.0
```

## GitHub Releases

GitHub and GitLab build on tags to create releases with:

- Release notes
- Downloadable assets (binaries, archives)
- Changelog

```bash
# Create release from CLI (GitHub)
gh release create v1.2.0 --title "Version 1.2.0" --notes "Release notes here"

# Create release with files
gh release create v1.2.0 app.zip --title "Version 1.2.0"
```

## Common Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git tag` | List all tags |
| `git tag v1.0.0` | Create lightweight tag |
| `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "msg"` | Create annotated tag |
| `git tag -a v1.0.0 abc123` | Tag specific commit |
| `git show v1.0.0` | Show tag details |
| `git push origin v1.0.0` | Push single tag |
| `git push --tags` | Push all tags |
| `git tag -d v1.0.0` | Delete local tag |
| `git push origin --delete v1.0.0` | Delete remote tag |
| `git checkout v1.0.0` | Checkout tag (detached) |

## Key Takeaways

- Tags mark specific commits as important versions
- Use annotated tags (`-a`) for releases with proper metadata
- Tags must be pushed separately with `--tags` or by name
- Follow semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Never move or delete public tags - they should be permanent
- Create branches from tags if you need to make changes
