## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **SDLC** | Software Development Life Cycle -- structured process for building software |
| **Waterfall** | Linear, sequential model where each phase completes before the next begins |
| **V-Model** | Waterfall extension that pairs each design phase with a matching test phase |
| **Agile** | Mindset for building software in short cycles with continuous feedback |
| **Scrum** | Agile framework with Sprints, three roles, five events, and three artifacts |
| **Kanban** | Flow-based method using visual boards and WIP limits |
| **DevOps** | Culture and practices that unify development and operations into one lifecycle |
| **Sprint** | Fixed time period (1-4 weeks) in Scrum for delivering a working Increment |
| **WIP Limit** | Cap on how many items can be in a Kanban column at once |
| **Shift-Left** | Moving testing, security, and quality checks earlier in the lifecycle |

## Model Comparison at a Glance

| Aspect | Waterfall / V-Model | Agile / Scrum | Kanban | DevOps |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Flow** | Sequential, one pass | Fixed Sprints (1-4 weeks) | Continuous | Continuous loop |
| **Change** | Costly, discouraged | Welcomed | Anytime | Automated and fast |
| **Delivery** | Single release at the end | Each Sprint | Continuous | Continuous |
| **Feedback** | Late (after deployment) | Every Sprint | Real-time board | Monitoring feeds planning |
| **Roles** | Traditional (PM, BA, Dev, QA) | PO, Scrum Master, Developers | No required roles | Shared Dev + Ops ownership |
| **Best For** | Stable requirements, regulated industries | Complex products, evolving needs | Support, ops, unpredictable work | Fast, reliable delivery at scale |

## Waterfall: Six Phases

| Phase | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Requirements** | Gather and document all needs | Requirements specification |
| **Design** | Plan architecture and technology | Design documents |
| **Implementation** | Write the code | Source code |
| **Testing** | Verify software meets requirements | Test reports |
| **Deployment** | Release to production | Live system |
| **Maintenance** | Fix bugs, make improvements | Patches and updates |

> Use when: requirements are stable, compliance needs documentation, technology is well understood, scope and budget are fixed.

## V-Model: Design-to-Test Mapping

| Design Phase (Left) | Creates | Test Phase (Right) |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------|
| Requirements | Acceptance criteria | Acceptance Testing |
| System Design | System test plan | System Testing |
| Architecture Design | Integration test plan | Integration Testing |
| Detailed Design | Unit test cases | Unit Testing |

> Key lesson: plan your tests during design, not after coding.

## Agile Manifesto: Four Values

| Value More | Over |
|------------|------|
| Individuals and interactions | Processes and tools |
| Working software | Comprehensive documentation |
| Customer collaboration | Contract negotiation |
| Responding to change | Following a plan |

Items on the right still matter. Items on the left matter **more**.

## Twelve Agile Principles (Summary)

1. Satisfy the customer through early, continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks, not months)
4. Business people and developers work together daily
5. Build around motivated individuals and trust them
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best communication method
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Maintain a sustainable pace -- no burnout
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity -- maximize the work NOT done
11. Self-organizing teams produce the best results
12. Reflect and adjust behavior regularly

## Scrum Quick Reference

### Three Roles

| Role | Owns | Key Responsibility |
|------|------|--------------------|
| **Product Owner** | Product Backlog | Decides what to build, orders by value |
| **Scrum Master** | Scrum Process | Removes blockers, coaches team (not a boss) |
| **Developers** | Sprint Work | Build the Increment, self-organize |

### Five Events

| Event | Timebox | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Sprint** | 1-4 weeks | Container for all work and events |
| **Sprint Planning** | Up to 8 hours | Answer: What will we deliver? How? |
| **Daily Scrum** | 15 minutes | Developers sync and coordinate |
| **Sprint Review** | Up to 4 hours | Show Increment to stakeholders, get feedback |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Up to 3 hours | Inspect the process, commit to improvements |

### Three Artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose | Commitment |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Product Backlog** | Ordered list of all product needs | Product Goal |
| **Sprint Backlog** | Items selected for this Sprint + plan | Sprint Goal |
| **Increment** | Working software that meets Definition of Done | Definition of Done |

## Kanban Quick Reference

### Four Foundational Principles

1. Start with what you do now
2. Agree to pursue incremental change
3. Respect current process, roles, and responsibilities
4. Encourage leadership at every level

### Six Core Practices

| Practice | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Visualize the workflow** | Board with columns for each stage |
| **Limit WIP** | Cap items per column to reduce overload |
| **Manage flow** | Watch for bottlenecks, clear them first |
| **Make policies explicit** | Write down rules for moving work between columns |
| **Implement feedback loops** | Regular meetings to review the system |
| **Improve experimentally** | Small, data-driven changes |

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Measures | Starts When | Ends When |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Lead Time** | Total time from request to delivery | Customer makes request | Work is delivered |
| **Cycle Time** | Active work time | Team starts working | Work is finished |

> Lead time includes waiting. Cycle time does not. The gap shows queue time.

## DevOps Lifecycle: Eight Stages

| Stage | Activity | Side |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Plan** | Define requirements | Dev |
| **Code** | Write and review | Dev |
| **Build** | Compile and package | Dev |
| **Test** | Automated quality checks | Dev |
| **Release** | Approve and stage | Ops |
| **Deploy** | Push to production | Ops |
| **Operate** | Run and scale | Ops |
| **Monitor** | Observe and feedback | Ops |

Monitoring feeds back into planning. The loop never ends.

### Core DevOps Practices

| Practice | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Continuous Integration** | Merge and test code multiple times per day |
| **Continuous Delivery** | Keep software always ready to release |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Define infrastructure in version-controlled files |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Watch production with automated tools and alerts |
| **Shift-Left** | Test and scan for security early, not at the end |

## SDLC Evolution Timeline

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1970 | Royce describes Waterfall | Sequential phases become standard |
| 2001 | Agile Manifesto published | Iterative development gains momentum |
| 2007 | Anderson adapts Kanban for software | Continuous flow enters software teams |
| 2008 | Debois and Shafer discuss Agile infrastructure | Seed of the DevOps idea |
| 2009 | First DevOpsDays in Ghent, Belgium | "DevOps" is named |
| 2013+ | Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform emerge | DevOps practices become mainstream |

## Decision Guide

### Choose Waterfall / V-Model when:
- Requirements are clear, complete, and will not change
- Regulatory compliance demands detailed documentation
- Safety-critical systems need formal verification
- Project has a fixed scope, budget, and deadline

### Choose Scrum when:
- Product requirements will evolve with feedback
- Cross-functional team can dedicate to Sprints
- Stakeholders are available for regular reviews
- Work can be split into shippable Increments

### Choose Kanban when:
- Work arrives unpredictably (support, ops, maintenance)
- Team wants to improve without changing roles or ceremonies
- Continuous delivery is needed without Sprint boundaries
- You want to visualize and optimize an existing process

### Choose DevOps when:
- Fast, reliable deployments are a business need
- Development and operations teams need to share ownership
- Automation of build, test, and deploy is a priority
- Continuous feedback from production should drive improvements

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using Waterfall when requirements are unclear | Switch to an iterative model |
| Skipping V-Model test planning | Plan tests during design, not after coding |
| Doing Agile ceremonies without the mindset | Change culture first, then process |
| Treating the Scrum Master as a boss | Scrum Master coaches and removes blockers, never assigns tasks |
| Kanban board with no WIP limits | Set and enforce limits -- this is what makes Kanban work |
| Ignoring Kanban bottlenecks | Stop starting new work and finish stuck items first |
| Treating DevOps as just tools | DevOps is culture first, automation second |
| Creating a separate "DevOps team" silo | Embed shared ownership across Dev and Ops |
| Skipping retrospectives in any model | Regular reflection is how teams improve |
