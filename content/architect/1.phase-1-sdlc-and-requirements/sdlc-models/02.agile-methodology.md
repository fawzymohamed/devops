        - "Strict contracts"
        - "Following a fixed process"
      correctAnswer: "Working software"
      explanation: "The Agile Manifesto states 'Working software over comprehensive documentation.' This does not mean documentation is bad -- it means delivering working software matters more."

        - "It requires a formal change review board for every request"
      correctAnswer: "It welcomes changes, even late in development"
      explanation: "One of the twelve Agile principles says: 'Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.' Agile sees change as a competitive advantage, not a problem to avoid."

        - "Responding to change over following a plan"
        - "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"
      explanation: "The Agile Manifesto has four values. 'Detailed documentation over working software' reverses the actual value, which prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation."

    - question: "Agile means you should never write documentation or make plans."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "This is a common misconception. The Agile Manifesto says it values working software MORE than documentation, and responding to change MORE than following a plan. The items on the right still have value -- the items on the left simply matter more."

      options:
        - "Number of documents completed"
        - "Lines of code written"
        - "Working software"
        - "Hours spent in meetings"
      correctAnswer: "Working software"
      explanation: "The tenth Agile principle states: 'Working software is the primary measure of progress.' Not plans, not documents, not effort -- actual software that works and delivers value."

# Agile Methodology

Before Agile, most software teams followed strict sequential plans. They spent months writing requirements, more months building, and then discovered that users wanted something different. Projects ran over budget, missed deadlines, and delivered software nobody needed.

In 2001, seventeen software practitioners met in Snowbird, Utah. They agreed on a better way to build software. The result was the **Agile Manifesto** -- a short document that changed the software industry forever.

As a DevOps architect, you will work with Agile teams daily. Understanding Agile is not optional -- it is the foundation of modern delivery practices and the culture that makes DevOps work.

## What is Agile?

Agile is a **mindset for building software through short cycles of planning, building, and learning**. Instead of delivering everything at the end of a long project, Agile teams deliver small pieces of working software frequently. They gather feedback after each delivery and adjust their plans.

Think of it like cooking a meal for a guest. The Waterfall approach cooks the entire five-course meal and serves it all at once -- hoping the guest likes everything. The Agile approach serves one dish at a time, asks "How is it?", and adjusts the next dish based on the answer.

Agile is not a single process or framework. It is a set of values and principles. Specific frameworks like Scrum and Kanban put these values into practice in different ways.

## The Four Values of the Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto states four core values. Each value compares two good things but says which matters **more**.

::

### 1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools

People solve problems, not tools. A skilled team with a whiteboard can outperform a mediocre team with expensive software. Good communication matters more than perfect processes.

### 2. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation

The best way to show progress is with software that runs and does something useful. Documentation still matters, but a 200-page specification that nobody reads is less valuable than a feature users can try today.

### 3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation

Instead of hiding behind a contract that says "you signed off on this," Agile teams work **with** customers to find the best solution. Conversations replace paperwork.

### 4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan

Plans are useful, but clinging to a plan when reality has shifted is wasteful. Agile teams adjust their direction when they learn something new. They treat change as a competitive advantage.

## The Twelve Principles

Behind the four values are twelve principles that guide Agile teams:

The principle about **simplicity** deserves special attention. It does not say "do less work." It says maximize the work you **do not do**. Skip features nobody needs. Avoid building things that add complexity without value.

## Agile vs. Waterfall

| Aspect | Waterfall | Agile |
|---|---|---|
| **Planning** | Big plan upfront | Plan in short cycles |
| **Delivery** | One delivery at the end | Frequent small deliveries |
| **Requirements** | Fixed at the start | Expected to change |
| **Feedback** | Late (after deployment) | Early and continuous |
| **Risk** | High -- problems found late | Lower -- problems found early |
| **Documentation** | Heavy and detailed | Enough to be useful |
| **Customer role** | Involved at start and end | Involved throughout |

Neither approach is always right. Some projects need Waterfall's structure (see the previous lesson). Most modern software projects benefit from Agile's flexibility.

## How Agile Connects to DevOps

Agile and DevOps share the same DNA. Agile focuses on **building software in short cycles**. DevOps extends this by making sure that software **flows smoothly from development to production**.

Key connections:

- **Frequent delivery** (Agile) needs **automated pipelines** (DevOps)
- **Customer collaboration** (Agile) needs **fast feedback loops** (DevOps)
- **Responding to change** (Agile) needs **infrastructure that adapts quickly** (DevOps)
- **Self-organizing teams** (Agile) need a **culture of shared ownership** (DevOps)

Without DevOps, Agile teams build features fast but get stuck waiting for deployments. Without Agile, DevOps teams automate delivery of features nobody asked for.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Doing Agile without being Agile** -- Some teams adopt Agile ceremonies (stand-ups, sprints) but keep a command-and-control culture. The rituals alone do not make a team Agile. The mindset must change too.

2. **Treating Agile as "no planning"** -- Agile teams plan constantly. They just plan in shorter horizons. Sprint planning, backlog refinement, and roadmap reviews all involve deliberate planning.

3. **Skipping retrospectives** -- The twelfth principle says to reflect and adjust regularly. Teams that skip retrospectives lose one of Agile's most powerful feedback loops.

4. **Ignoring technical excellence** -- Agile principle nine calls for continuous attention to good design. Teams that cut corners on code quality will slow down over time, no matter how good their process is.

## Key Takeaways

- Agile is a mindset defined by four values and twelve principles, not a specific set of rules
- The Agile Manifesto values working software, customer collaboration, people, and adaptability above processes, documentation, contracts, and rigid plans
- Agile teams deliver in short cycles, gather feedback, and adjust direction frequently
- The items on the "less" side of each Agile value still matter -- they just matter less
- Agile forms the cultural foundation that DevOps extends into operations and delivery
- The next lessons explore Scrum and Kanban -- two frameworks that put Agile values into practice
