      correctAnswer: "One month (four weeks)"
      explanation: "The Scrum Guide states that Sprints are fixed-length events of one month or less. Most teams use two-week Sprints. Shorter Sprints reduce risk and create faster feedback loops."

        - "To update the Product Backlog with new items"
      correctAnswer: "To inspect how the team worked and find ways to improve"
      explanation: "The Sprint Retrospective focuses on the team's process, not the product. The team discusses what went well, what went wrong, and what to improve. The Sprint Review is where the team shows finished work to stakeholders."

# Scrum Framework

The previous lesson introduced Agile as a mindset with values and principles. But how do you put that mindset into daily practice? **Scrum** is the most popular answer. It is a lightweight framework that helps teams deliver working software in short, repeating cycles called Sprints.

Scrum does not tell you how to write code or which tools to use. Instead, it gives you a clear structure of **roles**, **events**, and **artifacts** that create transparency and drive continuous improvement. As a DevOps architect, you will work with Scrum teams daily, and understanding this framework is essential for designing delivery pipelines that match how teams actually work.

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a **framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products**. It was created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in the early 1990s and is defined in the Scrum Guide.

Think of Scrum like a sports team's game plan. The team plays in short rounds (Sprints), reviews performance after each round, and adjusts their strategy for the next one. The coach (Scrum Master) does not play the game but helps the team perform at their best.

Scrum is built on three pillars:

- **Transparency** -- Everyone can see what is happening. Work, progress, and problems are visible to all.
- **Inspection** -- The team regularly checks their work and process to spot issues early.
- **Adaptation** -- When something is not working, the team adjusts quickly instead of waiting.

## The Three Scrum Roles

Every Scrum team has exactly three roles. There are no project managers, team leads, or other titles within the framework.

### Product Owner

The Product Owner decides **what** the team builds. This person manages the Product Backlog -- the ordered list of everything the product needs. The Product Owner talks to stakeholders, understands business needs, and makes sure the team works on the most valuable items first.

One person, one voice. The team should never get conflicting priorities from multiple people.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is a **servant-leader**. This person helps the team follow Scrum correctly, removes anything that slows the team down, and coaches the organization on Agile practices. The Scrum Master does **not** assign tasks or manage people.

Think of the Scrum Master as a coach, not a boss. A good coach makes the team better without playing the game themselves.

### Developers

Developers are the people who **build** the product. This includes programmers, testers, designers, and anyone else who does the work. In Scrum, developers self-organize -- they decide how to turn backlog items into working software.

The word "Developers" in Scrum does not mean only coders. It means everyone who creates the product Increment.

## The Five Scrum Events

Scrum defines five events. Each event has a clear purpose and a time limit (called a **timebox**). Timeboxes prevent meetings from dragging on forever.

### 1. The Sprint

The Sprint is the container for all other events. It is a fixed-length period (usually two weeks, never more than one month) during which the team creates a usable product Increment.

Key rules of a Sprint:
- **No changes** that would put the Sprint Goal at risk
- **Quality does not decrease** -- the Definition of Done is always met
- **The Product Backlog is refined** as needed during the Sprint
- The Sprint can be **cancelled** only by the Product Owner (this is rare)

### 2. Sprint Planning

At the start of each Sprint, the team answers two questions:

1. **What** can we deliver this Sprint? The team selects items from the Product Backlog and sets a Sprint Goal.
2. **How** will we get this work done? Developers break items into tasks and create a plan.

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For a two-week Sprint, it usually takes two to four hours.

### 3. Daily Scrum

A 15-minute meeting where developers sync up every day. Each person shares what they did, what they plan to do, and what is blocking them. The Daily Scrum is for developers -- the Product Owner and Scrum Master attend only if they are also doing development work.

The Daily Scrum is **not** a status report to a manager. It is a planning meeting where developers coordinate their work.

### 4. Sprint Review

At the end of the Sprint, the team shows the completed Increment to stakeholders. They discuss what was done, what changed, and what to work on next. This is a working session, not a formal presentation.

The Sprint Review creates a feedback loop between the team and the people who use their product.

### 5. Sprint Retrospective

After the Sprint Review, the team looks inward. The Retrospective asks: **How did we work together, and how can we improve?** The team discusses what went well, what went wrong, and commits to at least one improvement for the next Sprint.

This event is where continuous improvement actually happens. Teams that skip Retrospectives lose their ability to get better over time.

## The Three Scrum Artifacts

Artifacts are the things Scrum teams produce and use to create transparency.

| Artifact | Purpose | Owned By | Commitment |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Product Backlog** | Ordered list of everything the product needs | Product Owner | Product Goal |
| **Sprint Backlog** | Selected items + plan for the current Sprint | Developers | Sprint Goal |
| **Increment** | The sum of all completed work that meets the Definition of Done | Scrum Team | Definition of Done |

### Product Backlog

A living, ordered list of features, fixes, and improvements. Items at the top are small, detailed, and ready to work on. Items at the bottom are large and rough. The Product Owner constantly refines this list based on feedback and changing business needs.

### Sprint Backlog

The set of Product Backlog items the team selected for this Sprint, plus a plan for delivering them. Developers update the Sprint Backlog daily. It is a visible, real-time picture of what the team plans to accomplish.

### Increment and Definition of Done

The Increment is working software that meets the team's **Definition of Done** -- a shared checklist of quality standards. Every Sprint must produce at least one Increment. Each new Increment builds on all previous ones.

## Scrum and DevOps

Scrum and DevOps are natural partners. Scrum tells you **how to organize work**. DevOps tells you **how to deliver that work reliably**.

::

When a Scrum team has a strong CI/CD pipeline, they can deploy every Sprint Increment automatically. When they have good monitoring, Sprint Review feedback includes real usage data, not just opinions. DevOps makes Scrum faster and more reliable.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Turning the Daily Scrum into a status meeting** -- The Daily Scrum is for developers to coordinate, not for managers to track progress. If people report to a boss instead of talking to each other, the meeting loses its value.

2. **Changing scope mid-Sprint** -- Once the Sprint starts, the Sprint Goal should stay stable. Adding new work during a Sprint creates chaos. New ideas go into the Product Backlog for a future Sprint.

3. **Skipping the Retrospective** -- Teams that never reflect never improve. The Retrospective is where the team becomes better. Even experienced teams benefit from regular reflection.

4. **Having no clear Definition of Done** -- Without a shared standard, "done" means different things to different people. This leads to incomplete work, hidden bugs, and technical debt.

## Key Takeaways

- Scrum is a lightweight framework with three roles, five events, and three artifacts
- Sprints are fixed-length cycles (one month or less) that produce a working Increment
- The Product Owner decides what to build, the Scrum Master protects the process, and Developers build the product
- The five events (Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective) create a rhythm of delivery and improvement
- The Definition of Done ensures every Increment meets a consistent quality standard
- Scrum pairs naturally with DevOps -- Scrum organizes the work, DevOps automates the delivery
- The next lesson covers Kanban, an alternative Agile framework that uses a continuous flow instead of Sprints
