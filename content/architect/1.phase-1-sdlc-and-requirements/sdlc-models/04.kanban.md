    - question: "What is the primary goal of limiting Work In Progress (WIP) in Kanban?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "To give team members more free time"
        - "To reduce context switching and finish work faster"
        - "To prevent developers from starting any new work"
        - "To make the Kanban board look cleaner"
      correctAnswer: "To reduce context switching and finish work faster"
      explanation: "WIP limits stop the team from starting too many items at once. When people focus on fewer tasks, they switch context less and finish each item faster. The goal is smooth flow, not idle time."

      type: multiple
      options:
        - "Kanban uses a pull system where new work is pulled only when capacity is available"
        - "Kanban requires fixed-length iterations like Sprints"
        - "Kanban makes work visible using columns on a board"
        - "Kanban measures flow using metrics like lead time and cycle time"
      correctAnswers:
        - "Kanban uses a pull system where new work is pulled only when capacity is available"
        - "Kanban makes work visible using columns on a board"
        - "Kanban measures flow using metrics like lead time and cycle time"
      explanation: "Kanban uses a pull system, visual boards, and flow metrics. It does NOT require fixed iterations. Work flows continuously without Sprint boundaries."

    - question: "Kanban was originally created for the software industry."
      type: true-false
      correctAnswer: false
      explanation: "Kanban was created by Toyota in the 1940s for manufacturing. Taiichi Ohno designed the system to manage inventory and production flow. David J. Anderson later adapted it for software development in the 2000s."

    - question: "What is the difference between lead time and cycle time in Kanban?"
      type: single
      options:
        - "Lead time measures how long work takes from request to delivery. Cycle time measures how long active work takes."
        - "Lead time and cycle time are the same thing"
        - "Lead time is always shorter than cycle time"
        - "Cycle time includes waiting time but lead time does not"
      correctAnswer: "Lead time measures how long work takes from request to delivery. Cycle time measures how long active work takes."
      explanation: "Lead time is the total time from when a customer requests something to when it is delivered. Cycle time is the time from when the team starts working on the item to when it is done. Lead time includes waiting time in the backlog, so it is usually longer than cycle time."

    - question: "Which Kanban practice helps teams find and fix bottlenecks?"

      options:
        - "Using fixed Sprint lengths"
        - "Assigning tasks to specific people"
        - "Making workflow policies explicit and measuring flow"
        - "Holding daily stand-up meetings"
      correctAnswer: "Making workflow policies explicit and measuring flow"
      explanation: "When workflow rules are visible and the team measures flow metrics, bottlenecks become obvious. A column that keeps filling up shows where work gets stuck. The team can then focus on fixing that stage of the process."

# Kanban

The previous lesson covered Scrum, which organizes work into fixed-length Sprints. But not every team works best in time-boxed cycles. Some teams need a method that lets work flow continuously, without start and stop boundaries. That method is **Kanban**.

Kanban is simple to start but powerful in practice. It helps teams see their work, limit what they do at one time, and find bottlenecks that slow them down. As a DevOps architect, you will see Kanban boards everywhere -- in development teams, operations teams, and even in CI/CD pipeline dashboards. Understanding Kanban helps you design workflows that move smoothly from idea to production.

## What is Kanban?

Kanban is a **method for managing the flow of work**. The word "kanban" is Japanese and means "visual signal" or "card." The core idea is simple: make work visible, limit how much work happens at the same time, and improve flow step by step.

**Taiichi Ohno** created the Kanban system at Toyota in the 1940s. Factory workers used physical cards to signal when they needed more parts. This prevented overproduction and kept the assembly line running smoothly.

In 2007, **David J. Anderson** adapted Kanban for software teams. He kept the same core ideas -- visual signals, limited work in progress, and continuous improvement -- but applied them to knowledge work instead of factory floors.

## Kanban Principles

Kanban has four foundational principles that guide how teams adopt it:

Unlike Scrum, Kanban does not ask you to adopt new roles or ceremonies. You keep your current process and improve it piece by piece. This makes Kanban easy to start with any team, regardless of their current way of working.

## The Six Core Practices

Kanban defines six practices that teams follow to manage and improve their flow:

### 1. Visualize the Workflow

The most recognizable part of Kanban is the **Kanban board**. It is a board with columns that represent each stage of your workflow. Work items are cards that move from left to right as they progress.

A simple software team board might look like this:

| Backlog | Analysis | Development | Code Review | Testing | Done |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|------|
| Feature A | | Feature C | Feature D | | Feature E |
| Feature B | | | | Feature F | Feature G |
| Bug #12 | Bug #14 | | | | |

Each card on the board is a piece of work. Anyone on the team can look at the board and instantly understand what is happening. No status meetings needed.

### 2. Limit Work In Progress (WIP)

This is the practice that makes Kanban powerful. **WIP limits** cap the number of items allowed in each column at the same time.

Why does this matter? When a developer works on five things at once, they constantly switch between tasks. Each switch wastes time and mental energy. When they work on one or two things, they finish each item faster and with fewer mistakes.

A WIP limit of 3 on the "Development" column means the team can have at most three items in progress there. If all three slots are full, nobody starts new development work. Instead, they help finish existing items or assist with bottlenecks in other columns.

### 3. Manage Flow

The goal is smooth, predictable flow. Teams watch how work moves through the board and look for places where items pile up. A column that keeps filling up is a **bottleneck**. The team should focus on clearing that bottleneck before starting new work.

### 4. Make Policies Explicit

Write down the rules for how work moves between columns. For example: "A card moves from Development to Code Review only when the developer has written tests and pushed the code." When everyone knows the rules, handoffs are clean and expectations are clear.

### 5. Implement Feedback Loops

Kanban uses regular meetings to review the system. Common feedback loops include:

- **Daily stand-up** -- A quick sync to discuss blocked items and flow
- **Replenishment meeting** -- Choose which items to pull into the board from the backlog
- **Delivery planning** -- Decide when and what to release
- **Service delivery review** -- Review flow metrics and find improvements

### 6. Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally

Use data to make small, safe changes. Try an experiment (like lowering a WIP limit), measure the result, and keep the change if it helps. Kanban treats improvement as a continuous, evidence-based process.

## Kanban Metrics

Kanban teams use two key metrics to measure flow:

**Lead Time** -- The total time from when a customer requests work to when it is delivered. This includes all waiting time.

**Cycle Time** -- The time from when the team starts working on an item to when it is finished. This measures active work time.

| Metric | Starts When | Ends When | Includes Waiting? |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Lead Time** | Customer makes request | Work is delivered | Yes |
| **Cycle Time** | Team starts working | Work is finished | No |

Short cycle times mean the team works fast. Short lead times mean the customer gets value quickly. The gap between lead time and cycle time shows how long items wait before someone starts working on them.

## Kanban vs. Scrum

Both Kanban and Scrum are Agile approaches, but they work differently:

footnote: Many teams blend both approaches -- this is sometimes called Scrumban

::

Neither method is better than the other. Scrum works well for teams that benefit from a regular rhythm and clear roles. Kanban works well for teams that handle unpredictable work (like operations and support) or want to improve an existing process without major changes.

## Kanban and DevOps

Kanban is a natural fit for DevOps workflows. Operations teams deal with a constant stream of tasks -- incidents, deployments, infrastructure changes, and maintenance requests. These tasks do not fit neatly into two-week Sprints.

A DevOps team's Kanban board might have columns like:

**Requested** -- **Triaged** -- **In Progress** -- **In Review** -- **Deploying** -- **Done**

The WIP limits prevent the team from juggling too many incidents or changes at once. The board makes it easy for anyone to see what the team is working on and where work is stuck.

CI/CD pipelines themselves follow Kanban thinking. Code moves through stages (build, test, deploy) in a flow. When a stage fails, work stops moving forward until the problem is fixed -- just like a Kanban bottleneck.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using a board without WIP limits** -- A Kanban board without WIP limits is just a task list on a wall. The WIP limits are what create the pull system and make bottlenecks visible. Without them, teams overload themselves and flow breaks down.

2. **Ignoring bottlenecks** -- When a column fills up, the natural reaction is to start new work in another column. The correct response is to stop starting and start finishing. Help clear the bottleneck first.

3. **Never changing the board** -- The board should evolve as the team learns. If a column is never used, remove it. If work keeps getting stuck between two stages, add a column to make that handoff visible.

## Key Takeaways

- It came from Toyota's manufacturing system and was adapted for software by David J. Anderson
- WIP limits are the core practice that prevents overload and makes bottlenecks visible
- Lead time and cycle time are the key metrics for measuring flow
- Kanban does not require new roles or fixed iterations -- you start with your current process and improve
- Kanban fits DevOps teams well because operations work flows continuously rather than in Sprints
- The next lesson covers how DevOps itself evolved as an extension of these Agile and Lean ideas
